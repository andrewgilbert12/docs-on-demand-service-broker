The BOSH layer that underlies PCF generates `healthmonitor` metrics for all VMs
in the deployment.
However, these metrics are not included in the Loggregator Firehose by default.
To get these metrics, do either of the following:

* To send BOSH HM metrics through the Firehose, install the open-source
[HM Forwarder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-hm-forwarder).
* To retrieve BOSH health metrics outside of the Firehose, install the
[JMX Bridge](https://docs.pivotal.io/jmx-bridge/1-8/index.html) for PCF tile.
