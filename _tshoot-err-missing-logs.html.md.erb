If no logs are being emitted by the on-demand broker, check that your syslog
forwarding address is correct in Ops Manager.

1. Ensure you have configured syslog for the tile.

1. Ensure that you have network connectivity between the networks that the tile
is using and the syslog destination.
If the destination is external, you need to use the [public ip](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/tile.html#public-ip)
VM extension feature available in your Ops Manager tile configuration settings.

1. Verify that the Firehose is emitting metrics:
  1. Install the `cf nozzle` plugin.
  For instructions, see the [firehose plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose-plugin)
  GitHub repository.
  1. To find logs from your service in the `cf nozzle` output, run the following:

  		```
  		cf nozzle -f ValueMetric | grep --line-buffered "on-demand-broker/MY-SERVICE"
  		```

If no metrics appear within five minutes, verify that the broker network has access
to the Loggregator system on all required ports.
