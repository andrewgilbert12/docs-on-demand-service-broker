From the BOSH CLI, you can run service broker errands that manage the service brokers and perform mass operations on the service instances that the brokers created. These service broker errands include:

* [`register-broker`](#register-broker) registers a broker with the Cloud Controller and lists it in the Marketplace
* [`deregister-broker`](#deregister-broker) deregisters a broker with the Cloud Controller and removes it from the Marketplace
* [`upgrade-all-service-instances`](#upgrade-all) upgrades existing instances of a service to its latest installed version
* [`delete-all-service-instances`](#delete-all) deletes all instances of service
* [`orphan-deployments`](#detect-orphans) detects "orphan" instances that are running on BOSH but not registered with the Cloud Controller

To run errands:

1. **For BOSH CLI v1 only:** Select the broker deployment by running this command:<br>
	`bosh deployment BOSH_MANIFEST.yml`

2. Run one of the following commands depending on your Ops Manager version:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh run errand ERRAND_NAME`|
	| 1.11 | `bosh2 -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME run-errand ERRAND_NAME` |
	| 1.12 and later | `bosh -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME run-errand ERRAND_NAME` |

	<br>Examples:
	<br>`bosh run errand deregister-broker`
	<br> `bosh2 -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand deregister-broker`
