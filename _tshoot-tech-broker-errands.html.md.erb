From the BOSH CLI, you can run service broker errands that manage the service
brokers and perform mass operations on the service instances that the brokers created.
These service broker errands include:

* [`register-broker`](#register-broker) registers a broker with the Cloud Controller
and lists it in the Marketplace.

* [`deregister-broker`](#deregister-broker) deregisters a broker with the Cloud
Controller and removes it from the Marketplace.

* [`upgrade-all-service-instances`](#upgrade-all) upgrades existing instances of
a service to its latest installed version.

* [`delete-all-service-instances`](#delete-all) deletes all instances of service.

* [`orphan-deployments`](#detect-orphans) detects "orphan" instances that are
running on BOSH but not registered with the Cloud Controller.

To run an errand, run the following command:

```
bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand ERRAND-NAME
```

For example:

<pre class="terminal">bosh -d my-deployment run-errand deregister-broker</pre>
