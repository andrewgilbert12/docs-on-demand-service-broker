Some PCF services offer *on-demand* service plans.
These plans let developers provision service instances when they want. 

These contrast with the more common *pre-provisioned* service plans,
which require operators to provision the service instances during installation and configuration through the service tile UI.

The following PCF services offer on-demand service plans:

* MySQL for PCF v2.0 and later

* RabbitMQ for PCF

* Redis for PCF

* Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC)

These services package and deliver their on-demand service offerings differently.
For example, some services, like Redis for PCF, have one tile,
and you configure the tile differently depending on whether you want on-demand service plans or pre-provisioned service plans.

For other services, like PCC, you install one tile for on-demand service plans and a different tile for pre-provisioned service plans.

The following table lists and contrasts the different ways that PCF services package on-demand and pre-provisioned service offerings.
