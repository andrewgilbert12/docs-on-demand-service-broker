Before BOSH 2.0, cloud operators pre-provisioned service instances from Ops Manager. 
In the BOSH Director **Networking** pane, they allocated a block of IP addresses 
for the service instance pool, and under **Resource Config** they provisioned pool 
VM resources, specifying the CPU, hard disk, and RAM they would use. 
All instances had to be provisioned at the same level. With each `create-service` 
request from a developer, Ops Manager handed out a static IP address from this block, 
and with each `delete-service` it cleaned up the VM and returned it to the available pool.

With BOSH 2.0 dynamic networking and Cloud Foundry asynchronous service provisioning, 
operators can now define a dynamically-provisioned service network that hosts instances more flexibly. 
The service network runs separate from the PCF default network. 
While the default network hosts VMs launched by Ops Manager, the VMs running in 
the service network are created and provisioned on-demand by BOSH, and BOSH lets 
the IaaS assign IP addresses to the service instance VMs. Each dynamic network 
attached to a job instance is typically represented as its own Network Interface 
Controller in the IaaS layer.

Designating a network as a service network prevents Ops Manager from creating VMs 
in the network, leaving instance creation to the underlying BOSH.
When they deploy an on-demand service, operators select a service network when 
configuring the tile for that on-demand service.
