PCF components, like the Cloud Controller and UAA, run on the PCF default network.
In PCF v2.0 and earlier, on-demand PCF services require that you host them on a network that runs
separately from the PCF default network.

Cloud operators pre-provision service instances from Ops Manager. Then, for each service, Ops
Manager allocates and recovers static IP addresses from a pre-defined block of addresses.

To enable on-demand services in PCF v2.0 and earlier, operators must create a service networks in
Ops Manager Director and select the **Service Network** checkbox. Operators then can select the
service network to host on-demand service instances when they configure the tile for that service.
