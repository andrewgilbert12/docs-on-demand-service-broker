1. To target an individual service instance deployment, retrieve the GUID of your service instance with the cf CLI command `cf service MY-SERVICE --guid`.

1. Run `bosh status --uuid` to retrieve the BOSH Director GUID.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: "GUID" and "UUID" mean the same thing.</p>

1. To download your BOSH manifest for the service, run `bosh download manifest service-instance_SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID MY-SERVICE.yml` using the GUID you just obtained and a filename you want to save the manifest as.

1. Edit the following line in the service instance manifest that you just saved, to include the current BOSH Director GUID:
<pre class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;director_uuid: BOSH-DIRECTOR-GUID
</pre>

1. Run `bosh deployment MY-SERVICE.yml` to select the deployment using the Director UUID.

1. Run `bosh instances` to view VMs in the deployment.

1. Run `bosh ssh INSTANCE-ID` to SSH onto the VM.

1. Run `bosh logs INSTANCE-ID` to download instance logs.
