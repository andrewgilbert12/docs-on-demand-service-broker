If developers report errors such as the following:

<pre class="terminal">
Instance provisioning failed: There was a problem completing your request. Please contact your operations team providing the following information: service: redis-acceptance, service-instance-guid: ae9e232c-0bd5-4684-af27-1b08b0c70089, broker-request-id: 63da3a35-24aa-4183-aec6-db8294506bac, task-id: 442, operation: create
</pre>


1. If the BOSH error shows a problem with the deployment manifest:

	1. Download the manifest for the on-demand service instance by running:<br> `bosh download manifest service-instance_SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID MY-SERVICE.yml.`<br><br>
	1. Check the manifest for configuration errors.

	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This error does not apply if you are using BOSH CLI v2. In that case, to troubleshoot possible problems with the manifest, open it in a text editor and inspect the manifest there.</p>

1. To continue troubleshooting, [Log in to BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in) and target <%= vars.service_name_article_full %> instance using the instructions on [parsing a Cloud Foundry error message](#parse-error).

1. Retrieve the BOSH task ID from the error message and run one of the following commands depending on your Ops Manager version:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh task TASK-ID`|
	| 1.11  | `bosh2 task TASK-ID` |
	| 1.12 and later  | `bosh task TASK-ID` |

1. If you need more information, [access the broker logs](#access-broker) and use the `broker-request-id` from the error message above to search the logs for more information. Check for:
  * [Authentication errors](#auth)
  * [Network errors](#network)
  * [Quota errors](#quotas)
