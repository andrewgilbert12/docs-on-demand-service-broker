On-demand provisioning is intended to accelerate application development teams since it eliminates the need for development teams to request/wait for Operators to create a service instance for them. However, Operations teams and Administrators still need to ensure responsible use and keep resource costs in check. There are multiple ways for Service Operators and CF admins to control the provisioning of on-demand service instances.

In the lingua franca of Cloud Foundry, we refer to these limits as `quotas`.

## Creating service level quotas

A service level quota refers to the maximum number of service instances that can be created by a given service broker, and this is independent by service (e.g. if you have p.redis and p.rabbitmq, you can set independent quotas for each broker). This quota can be set in the service tile in Ops Manager, as shown in the picture below:
