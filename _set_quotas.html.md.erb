On-demand provisioning is intended to accelerate application development teams since it eliminates the need for development teams to request/wait for Operators to create a service instance for them.

There are multiple ways for Service Operators and CF admins to control the provisioning of on-demand service instances.

In the lingua franca of Cloud Foundry, we refer to these limits as `quotas`.
