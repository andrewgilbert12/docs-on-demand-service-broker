You need the GUID of your service instance to run some BOSH commands. 
To retrieve the GUID, run the command `cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid `.

If you do not know the name of the service instance, run `cf services` to see a listing of all service instances in the space. The service instances are listed in the name column.
