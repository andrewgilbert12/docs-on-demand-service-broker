The `register-broker` errand registers the broker with Cloud Foundry and enables access to plans in the service catalog. Run this errand whenever the broker is re-deployed with new catalog metadata to update the Cloud Foundry catalog.

Plans with disabled service access are not visible to non-admin Cloud Foundry users (including Org Managers and Space Managers). Admin Cloud Foundry users can see all plans including those with disabled service access.

The errand does the following:

* Registers the service broker with Cloud Controller.
* Enables service access for any plans that have the radio button set to `enabled` in the tile plan page.
* Disables service access for any plans that have the radio button set to `disabled` in the tile plan page.
* Does nothing for any for any plans that have the radio button set to `manual`.


To run the errand, do the following:

1. **For BOSH CLI v1 only:** Select the broker deployment by running this command:<br>
	`bosh deployment BOSH_MANIFEST.yml`

2. Run one of the following commands depending on your Ops Manager version:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh run errand register-broker`|
	| 1.11 | `bosh2 -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand register-broker` |
	| 1.12 and later | `bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME run-errand register-broker` |
