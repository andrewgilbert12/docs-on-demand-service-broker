The `register-broker` errand registers the broker with Cloud Foundry and enables
access to plans in the service catalog.
Run this errand whenever the broker is re-deployed with new catalog metadata to
update the Cloud Foundry catalog.

Plans with disabled service access are not visible to non-admin Cloud Foundry
users, including Org Managers and Space Managers.
Admin Cloud Foundry users can see all plans including those with disabled service access.

The errand does the following:

* Registers the service broker with Cloud Controller.

* Enables service access for any plans that have the radio button set to `enabled`
in the tile plan page.

* Disables service access for any plans that have the radio button set to `disabled`
in the tile plan page.

* Does nothing for any for any plans that have the radio button set to `manual`.
