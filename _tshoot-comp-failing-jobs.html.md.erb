To determine whether there is an issue with <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> deployment, inspect the VMs. To do so, run one of the following commands:

| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
|-----|---------|
| 1.10 or below | `bosh vms --vitals service-instance_GUID`|
| 1.11 and 1.12 | `bosh2 -d service-instance_GUID vms --vitals` |
| 2.0 | `bosh -d service-instance_GUID vms --vitals` |


For additional information, run one of the following commands:

| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
|-----|---------|
| 1.10 or below | `bosh instances --ps --vitals`|
| 1.11 and 1.12 | `bosh2 instances --ps --vitals` |
| 2.0 | `bosh instances --ps --vitals` |


If the VM is failing, follow the service-specific information.
Any unadvised corrective actions (such as running BOSH `restart` on a VM) can cause issues in the service instance.
