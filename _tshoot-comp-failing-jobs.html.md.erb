To determine whether there is an issue with <%=vars.service_name_article_full%>
deployment, inspect the VMs.
To do so, run the following command:

```
bosh -d service-instance_GUID vms --vitals
```

For additional information, run the following command:

```
bosh instances --ps --vitals
```

If the VM is failing, follow the service-specific information.
Any unadvised corrective actions (such as running BOSH `restart` on a VM) can
cause issues in the service instance.
