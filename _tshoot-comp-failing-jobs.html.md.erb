#### BOSH CLI v2: Troubleshooting the deployment

This procedure is for v2 of the BOSH CLI.

To determine whether there is an issue with <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> deployment, inspect the VMs.

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh2 -d service-instance_SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID vms --vitals 
</pre>

For additional information, run `bosh2 instances`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh2 instances --ps --vitals
</pre>

If the VM is failing, follow the service-specific information.
Any unadvised corrective actions (such as running `bosh2 restart` on a VM) can cause issues in the service instance.
