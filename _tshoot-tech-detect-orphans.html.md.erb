A service instance is defined as ‘orphaned’ when the BOSH deployment for the instance is still running, but the service is no longer registered in Cloud Foundry.

The `orphan-deployments` errand collates a list of service deployments that have no matching service instances in Cloud Foundry and return the list to the operator. It is then up to the operator to remove the orphaned bosh deployments.

Run this errand with the command `bosh run errand orphan-deployments` after you have selected the broker deployment with `bosh deployment`.

If orphan deployments exist, the errand script will:

- Exit with exit code 10
- Output a list of deployment names under a `[stdout]` header
- Provide a detailed error message under a `[stderr]` header

For example:
<pre class="terminal">
[stdout]
[{"deployment\_name":"service-instance\_80e3c5a7-80be-49f0-8512-44840f3c4d1b"}]

[stderr]
Orphan BOSH deployments detected with no corresponding service instance in Cloud Foundry. Before deleting any deployment it is recommended to verify the service instance no longer exists in Cloud Foundry and any data is safe to delete.

Errand 'orphan-deployments' completed with error (exit code 10)
</pre>

These details will also be available through the BOSH `/tasks/` API endpoint for use in scripting:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl 'https://bosh-user:bosh-password@bosh-url:25555/tasks/task-id/output?type=result' | jq .
{
  "exit_code": 10,
  "stdout": "[{"deployment_name":"service-instance_80e3c5a7-80be-49f0-8512-44840f3c4d1b"}]\n",
  "stderr": "Orphan BOSH deployments detected with no corresponding service instance in Cloud Foundry. Before deleting any deployment it is recommended to verify the service instance no longer exists in Cloud Foundry and any data is safe to delete.\n",
  "logs": {
    "blobstore_id": "d830c4bf-8086-4bc2-8c1d-54d3a3c6d88d"
  }
}
</pre>


If no orphan deployments exist, the errand script will:

- Exit with exit code 0
- Stdout will be an empty list of deployments
- Stderr will be `None`

<pre class="terminal">
[stdout]
[]

[stderr]
None

Errand 'orphan-deployments' completed successfully (exit code 0)
</pre>

If the errand encounters an error during running it will:

- Exit with exit 1
- Stdout will be empty
- Any error messages will be under stderr

To clean up orphaned instances, perform the following action on each:
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh delete deployment service-instance_SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID
</pre>
