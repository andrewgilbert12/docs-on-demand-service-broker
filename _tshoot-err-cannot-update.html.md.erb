Their service instance might not be running the latest service offering.

Operators must run the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand after upgrading
to ensure all existing service instances are upgraded to the latest service offering.
See [Upgrade All Service Instances](#upgrade-all).

App developers cannot upgrade individual service instances to the latest service
offering.
They cannot set parameters or change plan until you upgrade their service instances.
