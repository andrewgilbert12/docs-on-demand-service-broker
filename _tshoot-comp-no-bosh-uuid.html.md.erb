#### BOSH CLI v2: Does not apply

The manifest is not configurable through v2 of the BOSH CLI. 

#### BOSH CLI v1: Modify the manifest

This procedure is for v1 of the BOSH CLI.

You must re-add the `director_uuid` to the manifest. 

1. Run `bosh status --uuid` and record the `director_uuid` value from the output.

1. Edit the manifest and add the `director_uuid: DIRECTOR-UUID` from the last step at the top of the manifest.

For more, see [Deployment Identification](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html#deployment) in the BOSH docs.
