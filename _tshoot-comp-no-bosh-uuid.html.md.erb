### BOSH v2 CLI
If you're using the BOSH v2 CLI, this error should not occur. The `director_uuid` is not a configurable field for BOSH v2.

### BOSH v1 CLI
If using the BOSH v1 CLI, re-add the `director_uuid` to the manifest:

1. Run `bosh status --uuid` and record the `director_uuid` value from the output.

1. Edit the manifest and add the `director_uuid: DIRECTOR-UUID` from the last step at the top of the manifest.

For more, see [Deployment Identification](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html#deployment) in the BOSH docs.
