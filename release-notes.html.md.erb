- `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand supports parallel upgrades and
  the ability to select the number of canary instances that should be upgraded
  first. Upgrade `canaries`, when configured alongside a `max_in_flight`
  greater than 1, specify the number of service instances which must first be
  successfully upgraded, before the `upgrade-all-instances-errand` will
  attempt to upgrade the remaining instances.
  [See full documentation here](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-20/operating.html#upgrade-all-instances)
- Added support for Credhub v1.7.
- Added support for the OSBAPI v2.13
  [context object](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/profile.md#context-object).
  This allows service authors to obtain platform-specific information
  that is sent on provision, update, and bind requests.
- Provide a summary message for upgrade-all-service-instances errand.
- Expose BOSH error messages to application developers when `expose_bosh_errors`
  flag is enabled in manifest.
- Bump to Golang 1.10
- Addons support in the BOSH manifest
- Added `instance_groups.env` to `service_catalog.plans`. This property accepts
  an arbitrary hash, to support passing through undocumented properties
- Added support for optional `features` block, which enables BOSH features
  to be toggled in service instance deployments.
  [See full documentation here](https://docs.pivotal.io/svc-sdk/odb/0-20/creating.html#bosh_features)
- Amend endpoints for deleting service instances and fetching catalog to be
  compliant with OSBAPI v2.13 [specification](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md)
