If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: instance does not exist`
</pre>

1. Run `cf service MY-INSTANCE --guid` to check that <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> instance exists in BOSH and CF.

1. Run `bosh vms service-instance_GUID` with the GUID you just obtained.

If the bosh deployment is not found then it has been deleted from BOSH. Contact Pivotal support for further assistance on recovery.
