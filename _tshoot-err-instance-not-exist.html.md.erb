If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: instance does not exist`
</pre>

Follow these steps:

1. Type `cf service MY-INSTANCE --guid`. This confirms that the <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> instance exists in BOSH and CF, and returns a GUID.

1. Using the GUID obtained above, run one of the following BOSH CLI commands depending on your Ops Manager version:

    | Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
    |-----|---------|
    | 1.10 and earlier | `bosh vms service-instance_GUID`|
    | 1.11  | `bosh2 -d service-instance_GUID vms` |
    | 1.12 and later  | `bosh -d service-instance_GUID vms` |

If the BOSH deployment is not found, it has been deleted from BOSH. Contact Pivotal support for further assistance.
