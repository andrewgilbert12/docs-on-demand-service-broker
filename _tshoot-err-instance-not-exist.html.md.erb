If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: instance does not exist`
</pre>


1. Type `cf service MY-INSTANCE --guid`. This confirms that the <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> instance exists in BOSH and CF, and returns a GUID.

1. Using the GUID obtained above, run one of the following BOSH CLI commands depending on your PCF version:<br>
	* PCF 1.10 or below: `bosh vms service-instance_GUID`
	* PCF 1.11, 1.12: `bosh2 -d service-instance_YOUR-GUID vms`
	* PCF 2.0: `bosh -d service-instance_YOUR-GUID vms`

If the BOSH deployment is not found, it has been deleted from BOSH. Contact Pivotal support for further assistance.
