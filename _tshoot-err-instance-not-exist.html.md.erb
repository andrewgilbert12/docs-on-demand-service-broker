If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: instance does not exist`
</pre>

Follow these steps:

1. Confirm that <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> instance exists in BOSH and
obtain the GUID CF by running:

	```
	cf service MY-INSTANCE --guid
	```

1. Using the GUID obtained above, the following BOSH CLI command:

	```
	bosh -d service-instance_GUID vms
	```

If the BOSH deployment is not found, it has been deleted from BOSH.
