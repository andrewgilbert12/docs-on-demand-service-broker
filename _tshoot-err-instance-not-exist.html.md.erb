If developers report errors such as:

<pre class="terminal">
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: instance does not exist`
</pre>

Use your version of the BOSH CLI to troubleshoot.

#### BOSH CLI v2:

This procedure is for v2 of the BOSH CLI.

1. Type `cf service MY-INSTANCE --guid`. This confirms that the <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> instance exists in BOSH and CF.

1. Type `bosh2 -d service-instance_YOUR-GUID vms`, using the GUID you just obtained.

If the BOSH deployment is not found, it has been deleted from BOSH. Contact Pivotal support for further assistance.
