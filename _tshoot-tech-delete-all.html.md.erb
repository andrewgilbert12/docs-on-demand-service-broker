This errand deletes all service instances of your broker’s service offering in every org and space of Cloud Foundry. It uses the Cloud Controller API to do this, and therefore only deletes instances the Cloud Controller knows about. It will not delete orphan BOSH deployments.

Orphan BOSH deployments don’t correspond to a known service instance. While rare, orphan deployments can occur. Use the `orphan-deployments` errand to identify them.

The errand does the following:

1. Unbinds all apps from the service instances
1. Deletes all service instances sequentially. Each service instance deletion includes:
  1. Running any pre-delete errands
  1. Deleting the BOSH deployment of the service instance
  1. Removing any ODB-managed secrets from Credhub
  1. Checking for instance deletion failure, which results in the errand failing immediately
1. Checks if any instances have been created while the errand was running.
If new instances are detected, the errand returns an error.
In this case, it is advisable to re-run the errand.

<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING: </strong> Use extreme caution when running this errand. You should only use it when you want to totally destroy all of the on-demand service instances in an environment.
</p>

To run the errand, do the following:

1. **For BOSH CLI v1 only:** Select the broker deployment by running the command:<br>
`bosh deployment BROKER_MANIFEST.yml`.

2. Run one of the following commands depending on your Ops Manager version:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh run errand delete-all-service-instances`|
	| 1.11 | `bosh2 -d service-instance_GUID delete-deployment` |
	| 1.12 and later | `bosh -d service-instance_GUID delete-deployment` |
