On-demand PCF services rely on the BOSH 2.0 ability to dynamically deploy VMs in a dedicated network. 
The on-demand service broker uses this capability to create single-tenant service instances in a dedicated service network.

On-demand services use the dynamically-provisioned service network to host the single-tenant worker VMs that run as service instances 
within development spaces. This architecture lets developers provision IaaS resources for their service instances at creation time, 
rather than the operator pre-provisioning a fixed quantity of IaaS resources when they deploy the service broker.

By making services single-tenant, where each instance runs on a dedicated VM rather than sharing VMs 
with unrelated processes, on-demand services eliminate the "noisy neighbor" problem when one application 
hogs resources on a shared cluster. Single-tenant services can also support regulatory compliance where 
sensitive data must be compartmentalized across separate machines.

An on-demand service splits its operations between the default network and the service network. 
Shared components of the service, such as executive controllers and databases, run centrally on the default network 
along with the Cloud Controller, UAA, and other PCF components. 
The worker pool deployed to specific spaces runs on the service network.

The diagram below shows worker VMs in an on-demand service instance 
running on a separate services network, while other components run on the default network.
