This errand deregisters a broker from Cloud Foundry. It requires that there are no existing service instances. You can use the [Delete All Service Instances errand](#delete-all) to delete any existing service instances that are problematic.

The errand does the following:

- Deletes the service broker from Cloud Controller
- Fails if there are any service instances, with or without bindings

Run this errand with the command `bosh run errand deregister-broker` after you have selected the broker deployment with `bosh deployment`.
