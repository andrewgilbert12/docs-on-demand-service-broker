If you have rotated any UAA user credentials then you might see authentication issues in the service broker logs. 

To resolve this, redeploy the <%=vars.service_name%> tile in Ops Manager. This provides the broker with the latest configuration.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must ensure that any changes to UAA credentials are reflected in the OpsManager <code>credentials</code> tab of the Elastic Runtime or Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile.</p>
