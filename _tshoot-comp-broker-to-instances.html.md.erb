To validate you can `bosh ssh` onto <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> broker, download the broker manifest and target the deployment, then try to reach the service instance.

If no BOSH `task-id` appears in the error message, look in the broker log using the `broker-request-id` from the task.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This procedure is the same for v1 and v2 of the BOSH CLI. When using the BOSH CLI v2, use <code>bosh2</code> instead of <code>bosh</code>.</p>
