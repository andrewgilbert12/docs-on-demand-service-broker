1. To validate you can `bosh2 ssh` onto <%=vars.service_name_article_full%> broker:
  * **With BOSH CLI v2:** Target the deployment, and reach the service instance.
  * **With BOSH CLI v1:** Download the broker manifest and target the deployment, then try to reach the service instance.


1. If no BOSH `task-id` appears in the error message, look in the broker log using the `broker-request-id` from the task.
