You can [access logs using Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/troubleshooting.html#component_logs) by clicking on the **Logs** tab in the tile and downloading the broker logs.

To access logs using the BOSH CLI, do the following:

1. Identify the on-demand broker (ODB) deployment by running one of the following 
commands, depending on your Ops Manager version:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh deployments`|
	| 1.11 | `bosh2 deployments` |
    | 1.12 and later | `bosh deployments` |

1. **For BOSH CLI v1 only:**
	1. Run `bosh download manifest ODB-DEPLOYMENT-NAME odb.yml` to download the ODB manifest.
	1. Select the ODB deployment using `bosh deployment odb.yml`.
	
1. View VMs in the deployment using one of the following commands:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh instances`|
	| 1.11 | `bosh2 -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances` |
    | 1.12 and later | `bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances` |

1. SSH onto the VM by running one of the following commands:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh ssh service-instance_GUID`|
	| 1.11 | `bosh2 -d service-instance_GUID ssh` |
	| 1.12 and later | `bosh -d service-instance_GUID ssh` |


1. Download the broker logs by running one of the following commands:

	| Ops Manager Version | BOSH Command |
	|-----|---------|
	| 1.10 and earlier | `bosh logs service-instance_GUID`|
	| 1.11 | `bosh2 -d service-instance_GUID logs` |
	| 1.12 and later | `bosh -d service-instance_GUID logs` |
	

The archive generated by BOSH or Ops Manager includes the following logs:

<table class="nice">
	<th>Log Name</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	<tr>
		<td>broker.log</td>
		<td>Requests to the on-demand broker and the actions the broker performs 
			while orchestrating the request (e.g. generating a manifest and calling BOSH). 
			Start here when troubleshooting.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>broker_ctl.log</td>
		<td>Control script logs for starting and stopping the on-demand broker.</td>
