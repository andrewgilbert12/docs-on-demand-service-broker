You can [access logs using Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/troubleshooting.html#component_logs)
by clicking on the **Logs** tab in the tile and downloading the broker logs.

To access logs using the BOSH CLI, do the following:

1. Identify the on-demand broker (ODB) deployment by running the following command:

	```
	bosh deployments
	```

1. View VMs in the deployment by running the following command:

	```
	bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME instances
	```

1. SSH onto the VM by running the following command:

	```
	bosh -d service-instance_GUID ssh
	```


1. Download the broker logs by running the following command:

	```
	bosh -d service-instance_GUID logs
	```

The archive generated by BOSH or Ops Manager includes the following logs:
