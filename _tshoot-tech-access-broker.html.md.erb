1. Run `bosh deployments` to identify the on-demand broker (ODB) deployment.
1. Run `bosh download manifest ODB-DEPLOYMENT-NAME odb.yml` to download the ODB manifest.
1. Select the ODB deployment using `bosh deployment odb.yml`.
1. View VMs in the deployment using `bosh instances`.
1. Run `bosh ssh INSTANCE-ID` to SSH onto the VM.
1. Run `bosh logs INSTANCE-ID` to download broker logs.

You can also [access logs using Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/troubleshooting.html#component_logs) by clicking on the **Logs** tab in the tile and downloading the broker logs.

The archive generated by BOSH or Ops Manager includes the following logs:
