## <a id="operator"></a>Operator Responsibilities
The operator is responsible for performing the following:

* Request appropriate networking rules for on-demand service tiles.
* Configure the BOSH director
* Upload the required releases for the broker deployment and service instance deployments.
* Write a broker manifest
  * See [v2-style manifest docs](http://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html) if unfamiliar with writing BOSH v2 manifests
  * Core broker configuration
  * Service catalog and plan composition
* Manage brokers
* Documentation for the operator

For a list of deliverables provided by the Service Author, see [Required Deliverables](creating.html#what-is-required-of-the-service-authors).

For an example manifest for a Redis service, see [redis-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/redis-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml).

For an example manifest for a Kafka service, see [kafka-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml).

## <a id="configure-bosh"></a>Set Up Your BOSH Director
Dependencies for the On-Demand Broker:

- BOSH director v257 or later (PCF 1.8) **Note:** does not support BOSH Windows
- Cloud Foundry v238 or later (PCF 1.8)

 <p class="note">**Note**: [Service instance lifecycle errands](#lifecycle-errands) require BOSH director v261 (PCF 1.10) or later.</p>

### <a id="ssl-certs"></a>SSL Certificates

If ODB is configured to communicate with BOSH on the director's public IP you may be using a self-signed certificate unless you have a domain for your BOSH director. ODB does not ignore TLS certificate validation errors by default (as expected). You have two options to configure certificate-based authentication between the BOSH director and the ODB:

1. Add the BOSH director's root certificate to ODB's trusted pool in the ODB manifest:

    ```yaml
    bosh:
      root_ca_cert: <root-ca-cert>
    ```

1. Use BOSH's `trusted_certs` feature to add a self-signed CA certificate to each VM BOSH deploys. For more details on how to generate and use self-signed certificates for BOSH director and UAA, see [Director SSL Certificate Configuration](https://bosh.io/docs/director-certs.html).

You can also configure a separate root CA certificate that is used when ODB communicates with the Cloud Foundry API (Cloud Controller). This is done in a similar way to above. Please see [manifest snippets below](#core-broker-configuration) for details.

### <a id="bosh-teams"></a>BOSH Teams

BOSH has a teams feature that allows you to further control how BOSH operations are available to different clients. We strongly recommend using it to ensure that your on-demand service broker client can only modify deployments it created. For example, if you [use uaac](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html) to create the client like this:

```bash
uaac client add <client-id> \
  --secret <client-secret> \
  --authorized_grant_types "refresh_token password client_credentials" \
  --authorities "bosh.teams.<team-name>.admin"
```

Then when you [configure the broker's BOSH authentication](#core-broker-configuration), you can use this client ID and secret. The broker will then only be able to perform BOSH operations on deployments it has created itself.

For more details on how to set up and use BOSH teams, see [Director teams and permissions configuration](https://bosh.io/docs/director-users-uaa-perms.html).

For more details on securing how ODB uses BOSH, see [Security](#security).

### <a id="cloud-controller"></a>Cloud Controller

ODB used the Cloud Controller as a source of truth about service offerings, plans, and instances. To reach Cloud Controller, ODB needs to be configured with credentials. These can be either client or user credentials:

* Client credentials: as of Cloud Foundry v238, the UAA client must have authority `cloud_controller.admin`.
* User credentials: a Cloud Foundry admin user, i.e. a member of the `scim.read` and `cloud_controller.admin` groups as a minimum.

Detailed broker configuration is covered [below](#core-broker-configuration).

## <a id="upload-releases"></a>Upload Required Releases

Upload the following releases to the BOSH director:

* on-demand-service-broker
* your service adapter
* your service release(s)

## <a id="broker-manifest"></a>Write a Broker Manifest

### <a id="core-broker-config"></a>Core Broker Configuration

Your manifest should contain one non-errand instance group, that co-locates both:

* the `broker` job from on-demand-service-broker
* your service adapter job from your service adapter release

The broker is stateless and does not need a persistent disk. The VM type can be quite small: a single CPU and 1 GB of memory should be sufficient in most cases.

An example snippet is shown below:

```yaml
instance_groups:
  - name: broker # this can be anything
    instances: 1
    vm_type: <vm type>
    stemcell: <stemcell>
    networks:
      - name: <network>
    jobs:
      - name: <service adapter job name>
        release: <service adapter release>
      - name: broker
        release: on-demand-service-broker
        properties:
          # choose a port and basic auth credentials for the broker
          port: <broker port>
          username: <broker username>
          password: <broker password>
          disable_ssl_cert_verification: <true|false> # optional, defaults to false. This should NOT be used in production
          cf:
            url: <CF API URL>
            root_ca_cert: <ca cert for cloud controller> # optional, see SSL certificates
            authentication: # either client_credentials or user_credentials, not both as shown
              url: <CF UAA URL>
              client_credentials:
                client_id: <UAA client id with cloud_controller.admin authority and client_credentials in the authorized_grant_type>
                secret: <UAA client secret>
              user_credentials:
                username: <CF admin username in the cloud_controller.admin and scim.read groups>
                password: <CF admin password>
          bosh:
            url: <director url>
            root_ca_cert: <ca cert for bosh director and associated UAA> # optional, see SSL certificates
            authentication: # either basic or uaa, not both as shown
              basic:
                username: <bosh username>
                password: <bosh password>
              uaa:
                url: <BOSH UAA URL> # often on the same host as the director, on a different port
                client_id: <bosh client id>
                client_secret: <bosh client secret>
          service_adapter:
            path: <path to service adapter binary> # optional, provided by the Service Author. Defaults to /var/vcap/packages/odb-service-adapter/bin/service-adapter

          # There are more broker properties that are discussed below
```

This snippet is using the BOSH v2 syntax, and making use of global cloud config and job-level properties.

Please note that the `disable_ssl_cert_verification` option is dangerous and **should not be used in production**.

### <a id="catalog"></a>Service Catalog and Plan Composition

The operator must:

1. Supply each release job specified by the Service Author exactly once. You can include releases that provide many jobs, as long as each required job is provided by exactly one release.
1. Supply one stemcell that is used on each VM in the service deployments. ODB does not currently support service instance deployments that use a different stemcell for different instance groups.
1. Use exact versions for releases and stemcells. The use of `latest` and floating stemcells are not supported.
1. Create Cloud Foundry [service metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#services-metadata-fields) in the catalog for the service offering. This metadata will be aggregated in the Cloud Foundry marketplace and displayed in Apps Manager and the `cf` CLI.
1. Compose plans. In ODB, service authors do not define plans but instead expose plan properties. The operator's role is to compose combinations of these properties, along with IAAS resources and catalog metadata into as many plans as they like.
  1. Create Cloud Foundry [service plan metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#plan-metadata-fields) in the service catalog for each plan.
  1. Provide resource mapping for each instance group specified by the Service Author for each plan.
     The resource values must correspond to valid resource definitions in the BOSH director's global cloud config.
     In some cases Service Authors will recommend resource configuration: e.g. in single-node Redis deployments, an instance count greater than 1 does not make sense.
     Here the operator can configure the deployment to span multiple availability zones, by using the [BOSH multi-az feature](https://bosh.io/docs/azs.html). For example the [kafka multi az plan](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml#L100). In some cases, service authors will provide errands for the service release. You can add an instance group of type errand by setting the lifecycle field. For example the [smoke_tests for the kafka deployment](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml#L93).
  1. Provide values for plan properties.
     Plan properties are key-value pairs defined by the Service Author. Some examples include a boolean to enable disk persistence for Redis, and a list of strings representing RabbitMQ plugins to load. The Service Author should document whether these properties are mandatory or optional, whether the use of one property precludes the use of another, and whether certain properties affect recommended instance group to resource mappings.

     Properties can also be specified at the service offering level, where they will be applied to every plan. If there is a conflict between global and plan-level properties, the plan properties will take precedence.
  1. Provide an (optional) update block for each plan.
     You may require plan-specific configuration for BOSH's update instance operation. The ODB passes the plan-specific update block to the service adapter. Plan-specific update blocks should have the same structure as [the update block in a BOSH manifest](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html#update). The Service Author can define a default update block to be used when a plan-specific update block is not provided, and whether the service adapter supports their configuration in the manifest.

Add the snippet below to your broker job properties section:

```yaml
service_deployment:
  releases:
    - name: <service-release>
      version: <service-release-version> # Exact release version

```

## <a id="route"></a>Route Registration

You can optionally colocate the `route_registrar` job from the [routing release](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-routing-release?all=1) with the on-demand-service-broker, in order to:

1. load balance multiple instances of ODB using Cloud Foundry's router
1. access ODB from the public internet

To do this, upload the release to your BOSH director and [configure the job properties](http://bosh.io/jobs/route_registrar?source=github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-routing-release&version=0.136.0), replacing the version in that docs URL query string as appropriate.

Remember to set the `broker_uri` property in the [register-broker errand](#register-broker) if you configure a route.

## <a id="service-instance-quotas"></a>Service Instance Quotas

ODB offers global and plan level service quotas to set service instance limits.

Plan quotas restrict the number of service instances for a given plan, while
the global limit restricts the number of service instances across all plans.

When creating a service instance, ODB will check the global service instance limit.
If it has not been reached, it will check the plan service instance limit.

Note: These limits do not include orphans. See [listing](#listing-orphans) and [deleting](#orphan-deployments) orphans.

## <a id="broker-metrics"></a>Broker Metrics

The ODB bosh release contains a metrics job, that can be used to emit metrics when colocated with [service metrics](https://network.pivotal.io/products/service-metrics-sdk/). You must include the [loggregator release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator) in order to do this.

Add the following jobs to the broker instance group:

```yaml
- name: service-metrics
  release: service-metrics
  properties:
    service_metrics:
      execution_interval_seconds: <interval between successive metrics collections>
      origin: <origin tag for metrics>
      monit_dependencies: [broker] # hardcode this
- name: metron_agent
  release: loggregator
  properties:
    metron_agent:
      deployment: <deployment tag for metrics>
    metron_endpoint:
      shared_secret: <metron secret>
    loggregator:
      etcd:
        machines: [<CF etcd IPs>]
    loggregator_endpoint:
      shared_secret: <loggregator secret>
- name: service-metrics-adapter
  release: <ODB release>
```

An example of how the service metrics can be configured for an on-demand-broker deployment can be seen in the [kafka-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml#L106) manifest.

We have tested this example configuration with loggregator v58 and service-metrics v1.5.0.

Please see the [service metrics docs](http://docs.pivotal.io/service-metrics) for more details on service metrics.

## <a id="startup-checks"></a>Broker Startup Checks

The following startup checks occur:

* Verify that the CF and BOSH versions satisfy the minimum requirement. **Note**: If your service offering includes lifecycle errands, the minimum requirement for BOSH will be higher. See [Set Up Your BOSH Director](#configure-bosh). If your system does not meet minimum requirements, you will see an insufficient version error. For example:
```
CF API error: Cloud Foundry API version is insufficient, ODB requires CF v238+.
```
* Verify that, for the service offering, no plan IDs have changed for plans that have existing service instances. If there are instances, you will see following error:
```
You cannot change the plan_id of a plan that has existing service instances.
```

## <a id="lifecycle-errands"></a>Service Instance Lifecycle Errands

 <p class="note">**Note**: This feature requires BOSH director v261 or later.</p>

Service Instance lifecycle errands allow additional short lived jobs to be run as part of service instance deployment. A deployment is only considered successful if the lifecycle errand successfully exits.

The service adapter must offer this errand as part of the service instance deployment.

ODB supports the following lifecycle errands:

- `post_deploy` - Runs after the creation or updating of a service instance. An example use case is running a health check to ensure the service instance is functioning. See the workflow [here](./concepts.html#post-deploy)
- `pre_delete` - Runs before the deletion of a service instance. An example use case is cleaning up data prior to a service shutdown. See the workflow [here](./concepts.html#pre-delete)

Service Instance lifecycle errands are configured on a per-plan basis. To enable lifecycle errands, the errand job must be:

- Added to the service instance deployment.
- Added to the plan's instance groups.
- Set in the plan's lifecycle errands configuration.

An example manifest snippet configuring lifecycle errands for a plan:

```yaml
service_deployment:
  releases:
    - name: <service-release>
      version: <service-release-version>
      jobs:
      - <service_release_job>
      - <post_deploy_errand_job>
      - <pre_delete_errand_job>
service_catalog:
  plans:
      - name: <CF marketplace plan name>
        lifecycle_errands:
          post_deploy: <post_deploy_errand_job>
          pre_delete: <pre_delete_errand_job>
        instance_groups:
          - name: <service_release_job>
            ...
          - name: <post_deploy_errand_job>
            lifecycle: errand
            vm_type: <vm type>
            instances: <instance count>
            networks: [<network>]
            azs: [<az>]
          - name: <pre_delete_errand_job>
            lifecycle: errand
            vm_type: <vm type>
            instances: <instance count>
            networks: [<network>]
            azs: [<az>]
```

Please note that changing a plan's lifecycle errands configuration while an existing deployment is in progress is not supported. Lifecycle errands will not be run.

## <a id="management"></a>Broker Management

Management tasks on the broker are performed with BOSH errands.

### <a id="register"></a>Register Broker

This errand registers the broker with Cloud Foundry and enables access to plans in the service catalog. The errand should be run whenever the broker is re-deployed with new catalog metadata to update the Cloud Foundry catalog.

Please note that if the `broker_uri` property is set, then you should also register a route for your broker with Cloud Foundry. See [Route registration](#route-registration) section for more details.

When `enable_service_access: false` is set, the errand will not change service access for any plan.

Individual plans can be enabled via the optional `cf_service_access` property. This property accepts three values: `enable`, `disable`, `manual`.

* `cf_service_access: enable`: register-broker errand will enable access for that plan
* `cf_service_access: disable`: register broker errand will disable access for that plan
* `cf_service_access: manual`: register-broker errand will perform no action

If the `cf_service_access` property is not set at all, the register-broker errand will enable access for that plan.

Plans with disabled service access will not be visible to non-admin Cloud Foundry users (including Org Managers and Space Managers). Admin Cloud Foundry users can see all plans including those with disabled service access.

Add the following instance group to your manifest:

```yaml
- name: register-broker
  lifecycle: errand
  instances: 1
  jobs:
    - name: register-broker
      release: <odb-release-name>
      properties:
        broker_name: <broker-name>
        broker_uri: <broker URI, only required when a route has been registered> # optional
        disable_ssl_cert_verification: <true|false> # defaults to false
        enable_service_access: <true|false> # defaults to true
        cf:
          api_url: <cf-api-url>
          admin_username: <cf-api-admin-username>
          admin_password: <cf-api-admin-password>
  vm_type: <vm-type>
  stemcell: <stemcell>
  networks: [{name: <network>}]
  azs: [<az>]
```

Run the errand with `bosh run errand register-broker`.

### <a id="delete-instances-and-deregister"></a>Delete All Service Instances and Deregister Broker

This errand performs a similar operation to the errand [delete-all-service-instances](#delete-instances) and [deregister-broker](#deregister-broker). In addition, it will also disable service access to the service offering before deleting all the instances, and then deregister the broker after all instances have been successfully deleted. We disable service access to ensure that new instances cannot be provisioned during the lifetime of the errand.

The errand will do the following operations:

1. Disable service access to the service offering for all orgs and spaces.
1. Unbind all applications from the service instances
1. Delete all service instances sequentially
1. Deregister the broker from Cloud Foundry

**This errand should only be used with extreme caution when you want to totally destroy all of the on-demand service instances and deregister the broker from the Cloud Foundry.**

Add the following instance group to your manifest:

```yaml
- name: delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker
  lifecycle: errand
  instances: 1
  jobs:
    - name: delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker
      release: <odb-release-name>
      properties:
        broker_name: <broker-name>
        polling_interval: <interval in seconds when waiting for service instance to be deleted> # defaults to 60
        polling_initial_offset: <offset in seconds before starting to poll Cloud Foundry to check if the instance has been deleted> # defaults to 5

  vm_type: <vm-type>
  stemcell: <stemcell>
  networks: [{name: <network>}]
  azs: [<az>]
```

 <p class="note">**Notes**: <br/>The `polling_interval` default is set to 60 seconds because the Cloud Controller itself polls the on-demand broker every 60 seconds. Setting your polling interval to anything lower than 60 seconds will not speed up the errand.<br/>The `polling_initial_offset` default is set to 5 seconds because we don't want the delete all errand to start polling cloudfoundry before cloudfoundry has finished processing the delete request and has contacted the broker. In systems with more load on cloudfoundry, this process could take a longer, in which case you might consider increasing the polling offset.

Run the errand with `bosh run errand delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker`.

### <a id="deregister-broker"></a>Deregister Broker

This errand deregisters a broker from Cloud Foundry. It requires that there are no existing service instances.

Add the following instance group to your manifest:

```yaml
- name: deregister-broker
  lifecycle: errand
  instances: 1
  jobs:
    - name: deregister-broker
      release: <odb-release-name>
      properties:
        broker_name: <broker-name>
        disable_ssl_cert_verification: <true|false> # defaults to false
        cf:
          api_url: <cf-api-url>
          admin_username: <cf-api-admin-username>
          admin_password: <cf-api-admin-password>
  vm_type: <vm-type>
  stemcell: <stemcell>
  networks: [{name: <service-network>}]
  azs: [<az>]
```

Run the errand with `bosh run errand deregister-broker`.

### <a id="delete-instances"></a>Delete All Service Instances

This errand deletes all service instances of your broker's service offering in every org and space of Cloud Foundry. It uses the Cloud Controller API to do this, and therefore only deletes instances the Cloud Controller knows about. It will not delete orphan BOSH deployments: those that don't correspond to a known service instance. Orphan BOSH deployments *should* never happen, but in practice they might. Use the [orphan-deployments errand](#listing-orphans) to identify them.

The errand will do the following operations:

1. Unbind all applications from the service instances
1. Delete all service instances sequentially
1. Check if any instances have been created while the errand was running
 1. If instances are detected the errand will fail
 1. Re-run the errand

**This errand should only be used with extreme caution when you want to totally destroy all of the on-demand service instances from Cloud Foundry.**

Add the following instance group to your manifest:

```yaml
- name: delete-all-service-instances
  lifecycle: errand
  instances: 1
  jobs:
    - name: delete-all-service-instances
      release: <odb-release-name>
      properties:
        polling_interval: <interval in seconds when waiting for service instance to be deleted> # defaults to 60
        polling_initial_offset: <offset in seconds before starting to poll Cloud Foundry to check if the instance has been deleted> # defaults to 5

  vm_type: <vm-type>
  stemcell: <stemcell>
  networks: [{name: <network>}]
  azs: [<az>]
```

 <p class="note">**Notes**: <br/>The `polling_interval` default is set to 60 seconds because the Cloud Controller itself polls the on-demand broker every 60 seconds. Setting your polling interval to anything lower than 60 seconds will not speed up the errand.<br/>The `polling_initial_offset` default is set to 5 seconds because we don't want the delete all errand to start polling cloudfoundry before cloudfoundry has finished processing the delete request and has contacted the broker. In systems with more load on cloudfoundry, this process could take a longer, in which case you might consider increasing the polling offset.

Run the errand with `bosh run errand delete-all-service-instances`.

### <a id="orphan-deployments"></a>Delete Orphaned Deployments

The deployment for a service instance is defined as 'Orphaned' when the Bosh
deployment is still running, but the service is no longer registered in
Cloud Foundry.

The `orphan-deployments` errand will collate a list of service deployments that
have no matching service instances in Cloud Foundry and return the list to the
operator. It is then up to the operator to remove the orphaned bosh deployments.

Run the errand with `bosh run errand orphan-deployments`.

If orphan deployments are present, the errand will output a list of deployment
names

```shell
[stdout]
[{"deployment_name":"service-instance_aoeu39fgn-8125-05h2-9023-9vbxf7676f3"}]

[stderr]
None

Errand 'orphan-deployments' completed successfully (exit code 0)
```

**Warning:** Deleting the bosh deployment will destroy the vm, any data present will be lost.

To delete the orphan deployment run `bosh delete deployment service-instance_aoeu39fgn-8125-05h2-9023-9vbxf7676f3`.

## <a id="updates"></a>Updates

### <a id="update-broker"></a>Update Broker

To update the [core broker configuration](#core-broker-config):

* make any necessary changes to the core broker configuration in the broker manifest
* deploy the broker

### <a id="updating-service-offering"></a>Update Service Offering

To update the service offering:

* make any changes to properties in the `service_catalog` of the broker manifest. For example, update the service metadata.
* make any changes to properties in the `service_deployment` of the broker manifest. For example, update the jobs used from a service release.
* deploy the broker

**Warning:** Once the broker has been registered with Cloud Foundry do not change the `service_id` or the `plan_id` for any plan. When the ODB starts it checks that all existing service instances in Cloud Foundy have a `plan_id` that exists in the `service_catalog`.

After changing the `service_catalog`, you should run the [register-broker errand](#register) to update the Cloud Foundry marketplace.

When the plans are updated in the `service_catalog`, then upgrades will need to be applied to existing service instances. See [upgrading all service instances](#upgrade-all-instances).

### <a id="disabling-service-plans"></a>Disable Service Plans

Access to a service plan can be disabled by using the Cloud Foundry CLI:<pre class="terminal">
$ cf disable-service-access \<service-name-from-catalog\> -p \<plan-name\>
</pre>

Also, when a plan has the property `cf_service_access: disable` in the `service_catalog` then the [register-broker errand](#register) errand will disable service access to that plan.

### <a id="remove-plans"></a>Remove Service Plans

A service plans can be removed if there are no instances using the plan. To remove the a plan, remove it from the broker manifest and update the Cloud Foundry marketplace by running the [register-broker errand](#register).

**Warning:** If any service instances remain on a plan that has been removed from the catalog then the ODB will fail to start.

## <a id="upgrades"></a>Upgrades

### <a id="upgrade-broker"></a>Upgrade the Broker

The broker is upgraded in a similar manner to all BOSH releases:

* upload new version of `on-demand-service-broker-release` BOSH release to the BOSH Director
* make any necessary changes to the core broker configuration in the broker manifest
* deploy the broker

### <a id="upgrade-service-offering"></a>Upgrade Service Offering

The service offering consists of:

* service catalog
* service adapter BOSH release
* service BOSH release(s)
* service stemcell

To upgrade a service offering:

* make any changes to the service catalog in the broker manifest
* upload any new service BOSH release(s) to the BOSH Director
* make any changes to service release(s) in the broker manifest
* upload any new service stemcell to the BOSH Director
* make any changes to the service stemcell in the `service_deployment` broker manifest
* deploy the broker

Any new service instances will be created using the latest service offering.

To upgrade all existing instances you can run the [upgrade-all-service-instances errand](#upgrade-instances).

**Warning:** Until a service instance has been upgraded, `cf update-service` operations will be blocked and an error will be shown, see [updating service offering](#updating-service-offering).

### <a id="upgrade-individual-instances"></a>Upgrade an Individual Service Instance

Cloud Foundry users cannot upgrade their service instances to the latest service offering.

Until a service instance has been upgraded, Cloud Foundry users cannot set parameters, or change plan until the service instance has been upgraded by an operator:<pre class="terminal">
$ cf update-service my-redis -c '{"maxclients": 10000}'
Updating service instance my-redis as admin...
FAILED
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: Service cannot be updated at this time, please try again later or contact your operator for more information.
</pre>

Operators should run the [upgrade-all-service-instances errand](#upgrade-instances) to upgrade all service instances to the latest service offering.

### <a id="upgrade-all-instances"></a>Upgrade All Service Instances

To upgrade all existing service instances after the service offering has been updated or upgraded:

1. Add the following instance group to your broker manifest:

    ```yaml
    - name: upgrade-all-service-instances
      lifecycle: errand
      instances: 1
      jobs:
        - name: upgrade-all-service-instances
          release: <odb-release-name>
          properties:
            polling_interval: <interval in seconds when waiting for service instance to be upgraded> # defaults to 60
      vm_type: <vm-type>
      stemcell: <stemcell>
      networks: [{name: <network>}]
      azs: [<az>]
    ```

1. Deploy the broker manifest.
1. Run the errand with `bosh run errand upgrade-all-service-instances`.

Note, the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand will trigger [service instance lifecycle errands](#lifecycle-errands) configured for the broker.

## <a id="security"></a>Security

### <a id="bosh-endpoints"></a>BOSH API Endpoints

The ODB accesses the following [BOSH API](https://bosh.io/docs/director-api-v1.html) endpoints during the service instance lifecycle:

| API endpoint                                                     | Examples of usage in the ODB                                                                                                                                 |

### <a id="bosh-uaa"></a>BOSH UAA Permissions

The actions that the ODB needs to be able to perform are:

Modify:

- `bosh deploy`
- `bosh delete deployment`
- `bosh run errand`

Read only:

- `bosh deployments`
- `bosh vms`
- `bosh tasks`

The minimum UAA authority required by the BOSH Director to perform these actions is `bosh.teams.<team>.admin`. Note: a team admin cannot view or update the director's cloud config, nor upload releases or stemcells.

For more details on how to set up and use BOSH teams, see [Director teams and permissions configuration](https://bosh.io/docs/director-users-uaa-perms.html).

#### Unused BOSH permissions
The team admin authority also allows the following actions, which currently are not used by the ODB:

- `bosh start/stop/recreate`
- `bosh cck`
- `bosh ssh`
- `bosh logs`
- `bosh releases`
- `bosh stemcells`

### <a id="ipsec"></a>PCF IPsec Add-On

The ODB has been tested with the [PCF IPsec Add-On](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html), and it appears to work. Note that we excluded the BOSH director itself from IPsec ranges, as the BOSH add-on cannot be applied to BOSH itself.

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

### <a id="admin-instances"></a>Administer Service Instances

We recommend using the [bosh cli gem](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-cli.html) for administering the deployments created by ODB; for example for checking VMs, ssh, viewing logs.

We **recommend against** using the bosh cli for updating/deleting ODB service deployments as it might accidentally trigger a race condition with Cloud Controller-induced updates/deletes or result in ODB overriding your [snowflake](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html) changes at the next deploy. All updates to the service instances must be done using the [errand to upgrade all service instances](#upgrade-instances).

### <a id="logs"></a>Logs

The on-demand broker writes logs to a log file, and to syslog.

The broker log contains error messages and non-zero exit codes returned by the service adapter, as well as the stdout and stderr streams of the adapter.

The log file is located at `/var/vcap/sys/log/broker/broker.log`. In syslog, logging is written with the tag `on-demand-service-broker`, under the facility `user`, with priority `info`.

If you want to forward syslog to a syslog aggregator, we recommend co-locating [syslog release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/syslog-release) with the broker.

The ODB generates a UUID for each request and prefixes all the logs for that request, e.g.

```
on-demand-service-broker: [on-demand-service-broker] [4d63080d-e038-45a3-85f9-93910f6b40b1] 2016/09/05 16:43:26.123456 a valid UAA token was found in cache, will not obtain a new one
```

NB: The ODB's negroni server and start up logs are not prefixed with a request ID.

All ODB's logs have a UTC timestamp.

### <a id="metrics"></a>Metrics

If you have [configured broker metrics](#broker-metrics), the broker will emit metrics to the CF firehose. You can, for example, consume these metrics by using the [CF CLI firehose plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/firehose-plugin).

#### Service-level Metrics
The broker will emit a metric indicating the total number of instances across all plans. In addition, if there is a global quota set for the service, a metric showing how much of that quota is remaining will be emitted. Service-level metrics use the format shown below.

```
origin:"<broker deployment name>" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:<timestamp> deployment:"<broker deployment name>" job:"broker" index:"<bosh job index>" ip:"<IP>" valueMetric:<name:"/on-demand-broker/<service offering name>/total_instances" value:<instance count> unit:"count" >
origin:"<broker deployment name>" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:<timestamp> deployment:"<broker deployment name>" job:"broker" index:"<bosh job index>" ip:"<IP>" valueMetric:<name:"/on-demand-broker/<service offering name>/quota_remaining" value:<quota remaining> unit:"count" >
```

#### Plan-level Metrics
For each service plan, the metrics will report the total number of instances for that plan. If there is a quota set for the plan, the metrics will also report how much of that quota is remaining. Plan-level metrics are emitted in the following format.

```
origin:"<broker deployment name>" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:<timestamp> deployment:"<broker deployment name>" job:"broker" index:"<bosh job index>" ip:"<IP>" valueMetric:<name:"/on-demand-broker/<service offering name>/<plan name>/total_instances" value:<instance count> unit:"count" >
origin:"<broker deployment name>" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:<timestamp> deployment:"<broker deployment name>" job:"broker" index:"<bosh job index>" ip:"<IP>" valueMetric:<name:"/on-demand-broker/<service offering name>/<plan name>/quota_remaining" value:<quota remaining> unit:"count" >
```

If `quota_remaining` is `0` then you need to increase your plan quota in the BOSH manifest.

### <a id="identifying-deployments"></a>Identify Deployments in BOSH

There is a one to one mapping between the service instance id from CF and the deployment name in BOSH. The convention is the BOSH deployment name would be the service instance id prepended by `service-instance_`. To identify the BOSH deployment for a service instance you can.

1. Determine the GUID of the service
   <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf service --guid \<service-name\>
   </pre>

1. Identify deployment in `bosh deployments` by looking for `service-instance_<GUID>`

1. Get current tasks for the deployment by using
   <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh tasks --deployment service-instance_\<GUID\>
   </pre>

### <a id="id-tasks"></a>Identify Tasks in BOSH

Most operations on the on demand service broker API are implemented by launching BOSH tasks. If an operation fails, it may be useful to investigate the corresponding BOSH task. To do this:

1. Determine the ID of the service for which an operation failed. You can do this using the Cloud Foundry CLI:
   <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf service --guid \<service name\>
   </pre>

1. SSH on to the service broker VM:
   <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh deployment \<path to broker manifest\>
    $ bosh ssh
   </pre>

1. In the broker log, look for lines relating to the service, identified by the service ID. Lines recording the starting and finishing of BOSH tasks will also have the BOSH task ID:

    ```

    ```

1. Use the task ID to obtain the task log from BOSH (adding flags such as `--debug` or `--cpi` as necessary):
   <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh task \<task\_ID\>
   </pre>

### <a id="id-uaa-issues"></a>Identify Issues When Connecting to BOSH or UAA

The ODB interacts with the BOSH director to provision and deprovision instances, and is authenticated via the director's UAA. See [Core Broker Configuration](#core-broker-configuration) for an example configuration.

If BOSH and/or UAA are wrongly configured in the broker's manifest, then meaningful error messages will be displayed in the broker's log, indicating whether the issue is caused by an unreachable destination or bad credentials.

For example

```
on-demand-service-broker: [on-demand-service-broker] [575afbc1-b541-481d-9cde-b3d3e67e87bf] 2016/05/18 15:56:40.100579 Error authenticating (401): {"error":"unauthorized","error_description":"Bad credentials"}, please ensure that properties.<broker-job>.bosh.authentication.uaa is correct and try again.
```

### <a id="listing-instances"></a>List Service Instances

The ODB persists the list of ODB-deployed service instances and provides an endpoint to retrieve them. This endpoint requires basic authentication.

During disaster recovery this endpoint could be used to assess the situation.

**Request**

`GET http://username:password@<ON_DEMAND_BROKER_IP>:8080/mgmt/service_instances`

**Response**

200 OK

Example JSON body:

  ```json

    }
  ]
  ```

### <a id="listing-orphans"></a>List Orphan Deployments

The On-Demand Broker provides an endpoint that compares the list of service instance
deployments against the service instances registered in Cloud Foundry. When called,
the endpoint will return a list of orphaned deployments, if any are present.

This endpoint is exercised in the [`orphan-deployments`](#orphan-deployments) errand. To call this endpoint
without  running the errand, use curl

**Request**
`GET http://username:password@<ON_DEMAND_BROKER_IP>:8080/mgmt/orphan_deployments`

**Response**

200 OK

Example JSON body:

```json
[
  {
	  "deployment_name": "service-instance_d482abd3-8051-48d2-8067-9ccdf02327f3"
  }
