title: Operating an On-Demand Broker
owner: London Services Enablement
---

This topic provides information about operating the on-demand broker for 
Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Ops Manager operators and BOSH operators.

## <a id="deliverables"></a> Operator Checklist

The operator is responsible for the following:

* Request appropriate networking rules for on-demand service tiles.
* Configure the BOSH Director.
* Upload the required releases for the broker deployment and service instance 
deployments.
* Write a broker manifest. See [Write a Broker Manifest](#broker-manifest).
* Manage brokers and service plans. See 
[Broker and Service Management](./management.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that you provide documentation
 when you make changes to the manifest so that other operators the new configurations.</p>

For a list of deliverables provided by the Service Author, see [Creating Service Author Deliverables](./creating.html).

## <a id="networking"></a>Set Up Networking

<%= partial 'service_networks_table' %>

<br>
Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must ensure network
rules are set up so that connections are open as described in the table below.

## <a id="configure-bosh"></a>Set Up Your BOSH Director

See the following topics for how to set up your BOSH Director:

* [Software Requirements](#software-reqs)
* [SSL Certificates](#ssl-certs)
* [BOSH Teams](#bosh-teams)
* [Cloud Controller](#cloud-controller)

### <a id="software-reqs"></a> Software Requirements

The On-Demand Broker requires the following:

- BOSH Director v257 or later (PCF v1.8) 
- Cloud Foundry v238 or later (PCF v1.8)

<div class="note"><strong>Notes</strong>: <ul><li>ODB does not support BOSH Windows.</li>
<li>Service instance lifecycle errands require BOSH Director v261 on PCF v1.10 or later.
For more information, see <a href="#lifecycle-errands"> Service Instance Lifecycle Errands</a>.</li></ul></div>


### <a id="ssl-certs"></a>SSL Certificates

If ODB is configured to communicate with BOSH on the Director's public IP, you may be using a self-signed certificate unless you have a domain for your BOSH Director. 
ODB does not ignore TLS certificate validation errors by default. 

You have two options to configure certificate-based authentication between the BOSH Director and the ODB:

* Add the BOSH Director's root certificate to ODB's trusted pool in the ODB manifest as follows:

    ```yaml
    bosh:
      root_ca_cert: ROOT-CA-CERT
    ```

* Use BOSH's `trusted_certs` feature to add a self-signed CA certificate to each VM that BOSH deploys. 
For how to generate and use self-signed certificates for BOSH Director and UAA, 
see [Configuring SSL Certificates](https://bosh.io/docs/director-certs.html) in the BOSH documentation.

Optionally, you can configure a separate root CA certificate that is used when ODB communicates with the Cloud Foundry API (Cloud Controller).
For an example of how to add this in the manifest, see the line containing 
`CA-CERT-FOR-CLOUD-CONTROLLER` in the manifest snippet in [Core Broker Configuration](#core-broker-config) below.


### <a id="bosh-teams"></a>BOSH Teams

You can use BOSH teams to further control how BOSH operations are available to 
different clients. For more information about using BOSH teams, 
see [Using Teams](https://bosh.io/docs/director-users-uaa-perms.html)
in the BOSH documentation.


To use BOSH teams to ensure that your on-demand service broker client can only modify deployments it 
created, do the following:

1. Run the following UAA CLI (UAAC) command to create the client:

    ```
    uaac client add CLIENT-ID \
      --secret CLIENT-SECRET \
      --authorized_grant_types "refresh_token password client_credentials" \
      --authorities "bosh.teams.TEAM-NAME.admin"
    ```
    <br>
    Where:
    * `CLIENT-ID` is your client ID.
    * `CLIENT-SECRET` is your client secret.
    * `TEAM-NAME` is the name of the team authorized to modify this deployment.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    uaac client add admin \
      --secret 12345679 \
      --authorized\_grant\_types "refresh\_token password client\_credentials" \
      --authorities "bosh.teams.my-team.admin"
    </pre>
    For more information about using the UAAC, see [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI (UAAC)
    ](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/uaa/uaa-user-management.html).

1. When configuring the broker's BOSH authentication, use the client ID and secret you provided above. 
The broker can then only perform BOSH operations on deployments it has created. See [Core Broker Configuration](#core-broker-config) below.


For more details on securing how ODB uses BOSH, see [Security](./security.html).

### <a id="cloud-controller"></a>Cloud Controller

ODB uses the Cloud Controller as a source of truth about service offerings, plans, and instances. 
To reach the Cloud Controller, configure ODB with either client or user credentials in the broker manifest. 
The client or user must have the following permissions:

* **If using client credentials**: As of Cloud Foundry v238, the UAA client must have the authority `cloud_controller.admin`.<br><br>
* **If using user credentials**: The user must be a Cloud Foundry admin user, that is, a member of the `scim.read` and `cloud_controller.admin` groups as a minimum.

For detailed information, see [Write a Broker Manifest](#broker-manifest) below.

## <a id="upload-releases"></a>Upload Required Releases

Upload the following releases to the BOSH Director:

* On-demand-service-broker
* Your service adapter
* Your service releases

## <a id="broker-manifest"></a>Write a Broker Manifest

The broker manifest contains:

* [Core Broker Configuration](#core-broker-config)
* [Service Catalog and Plan Composition](#catalog)

If you are unfamiliar with writing BOSH v2 manifests, see [Manifest v2 Schema](http://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html).

For example manifests, see the following:

  * For a Redis service---[redis-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/redis-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml).

  * For a Kafka service---[kafka-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml).


### <a id="core-broker-config"></a>Core Broker Configuration

Your manifest should contain one non-errand instance group that is colocated with both of the following:

* The broker job from `on-demand-service-broker`
* Your service adapter job from your service adapter release

The broker is stateless and does not need a persistent disk. 
The VM type can be small: a single CPU and 1 GB of memory is sufficient in most cases.

An example snippet is shown below. This snippet uses the BOSH v2 syntax and 
makes use of global cloud config and job-level properties.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: The <code>disable_ssl_cert_verification</code>
  option is dangerous and should be set to <code>false</code> in production</strong>.</p>

          # There are more broker properties that are discussed below
```


### <a id="catalog"></a>Service Catalog and Plan Composition

The operator configures the Service Catalog and composes plans in the manifest.  

To do so, use the starter [Starter Snippet](#starter-snippet) below in the broker job properties section of the manifest, and provide the following:

1. Supply each release job specified by the Service Author exactly once. You can include releases that provide many jobs, as long as each required job is provided by exactly one release.

1. Supply one stemcell that is used on each VM in the service deployments. ODB does not currently support service instance deployments that use a different stemcell for different instance groups.

1. Use exact versions for releases and stemcells. The use of `latest` and floating stemcells are not supported.

1. Create Cloud Foundry [service metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#services-metadata-fields) in the catalog for the service offering. 
  You can use other arbitrary field names as needed in addition to the OSBAPI recommended fields.
  This metadata will be aggregated in the Marketplace and displayed in Apps Manager and the cf CLI.

1. Compose plans. In ODB, service authors do not define plans but instead expose plan properties. 
The operator's role is to compose combinations of these properties, along with IAAS resources and catalog metadata into as many plans as they wish.
  1. Create Cloud Foundry [plan metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#plan-metadata-fields) in the service catalog for each plan. 
    You can use other arbitrary field names as needed in addition to the OSBAPI recommended fields.<br><br>
  1. Provide resource mapping for each instance group specified by the Service Author for each plan.
     The resource values must correspond to valid resource definitions in the BOSH Director's global cloud config.<br><br>
     In some cases Service Authors recommend resource configuration: for example, 
     in single-node Redis deployments, an instance count greater than 1 does not make sense.
     Here the operator can configure the deployment to span multiple availability zones 
     by using the [BOSH multi-az feature](https://bosh.io/docs/azs.html). <br><br>
     In some cases, service authors will provide errands for the service release. 
     You can add an instance group of type `errand` by setting the `lifecycle` field. 
     For an example see `register-broker` in the [example kafka deployment](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml).<br><br>
  1. Provide values for plan properties.
     Plan properties are key-value pairs defined by the Service Author.<br><br> 
     Some examples of these could be to include a boolean to enable disk persistence for Redis, 
     or a list of strings representing RabbitMQ plugins to load.<br><br>
     The Service Author should document whether these properties are mandatory or optional, 
     whether the use of one property precludes the use of another, and whether certain properties affect recommended instance group to resource mappings.<br><br>
     You can also specify properties at the service offering level, where they will be applied to every plan. 
     If there is a conflict between global and plan-level properties, the plan properties take precedence.<br><br>
  1. (Optional) Provide an  update block for each plan.<br><br>
     You may require plan-specific configuration for BOSH's update instance operation. <br><br>
     The ODB passes the plan-specific update block to the service adapter. 
     Plan-specific update blocks should have the same structure as [the update block in a BOSH manifest](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html#update). <br><br>
     The Service Author can define a default update block to be used when a plan-specific update block is not provided, 
     if the service adapter supports configuring update blocks in the manifest.

## <a id="secure-binding"></a>Enable Secure Binding

Optionally, ODB allows the secure storage of service credentials in runtime CredHub.
To use this feature, you must connect to CredHub v1.6.x or later.
This may be provided as part of your Cloud Foundry deployment.

Because the address for CredHub is a local domain name, your instance group
requires access to the local DNS provider.
Currently, most Cloud Foundry deployments use Consul as a DNS provider.

You must set up a new CredHub client in Cloud Foundry UAA with `credhub.write` 
and `credhub.read` in its list of authorities.

To enable secure bindings, you must do the following in the ODB manifest:

* Consume the CredHub link.
* Include the secure binding credentials section with `secure_binding_credentials.enabled`
set to `true`.
* If you use Consul as a DNS provider, you might want to consume Consul links to enable DNS.

If the Secure Binding Credentials section is omitted or if
`secure_binding_credentials.enabled` is `false`, service credentials,
as opposed to a secure reference, are passed through the network to the
application container.

An example manifest snippet, assuming you are connecting to a Cloud
Foundry deployment, is shown below:

```
instance_groups:
- name: broker
  ...
  jobs:
  - name: broker
    consumes:
      credhub:
        from: credhub
        deployment: cf
    properties:
      ...
      secure_binding_credentials:
        enabled: true
        authentication:
          uaa:
            client_id: CREDHUB-CLIENT-ID
            client_secret: CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
            ca_cert: ((cf.uaa.ca_cert))
  - name: consul_agent
    release: consul
    consumes:
      consul: nil
      consul_client:
        from: consul_client_link
        deployment: cf
      consul_common:
        from: consul_common_link
        deployment: cf
      consul_server: nil
```





### <a id="credhub-key-format"></a> How Credentials Are Stored on CredHub

The credentials for a given service binding are stored with the following format:

```
/C/:SERVICE-GUID/:SERVICE-INSTANCE-GUID/:BINDING-GUID/CREDENTIALS
```

The plain-text credentials are stored in CredHub under this key, and the key is
available under the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable for the app.

## <a id="plan-schemas"></a>Enable Plan Schemas

As of [OSBAPI Spec v2.13](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#changes-since-v212),
ODB supports plan schemas in the service catalog.

To use
this feature, do the following:

1. Set the `enable_plan_schemas` flag to `true`.
   The default is `false`.
2. Ensure that the service adapter implements the command `generate-plan-schemas`,
otherwise the broker fails to deploy.
For more information, see [generate-plan-schemas](creating.html#generate-plan-schemas).

During provision, bind, and update, the broker validates the incoming configuration
parameters against the schema and produces an error if the parameters do not conform.

## <a id="route"></a>Route Registration

You can optionally colocate the `route_registrar` job from the 
[routing release](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-routing-release?all=1) 
with the on-demand-service-broker, to do the following:

* Load balance multiple instances of ODB using Cloud Foundry router
* Access ODB from the public internet

To do this:

1. Download the [routing release](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-routing-release?all=1).
1. Upload the routing release to your BOSH Director. 
1. [Configure the job properties](http://bosh.io/jobs/route_registrar?source=github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-routing-release&version=0.136.0), 
replacing the URL query string as appropriate.
1. If you configure a route, set the `broker_uri` property in the [register-broker errand](#register-broker).

## <a id="service-instance-quotas"></a>Service Instance Quotas

You can set global and plan level service quotas to set service instance limits in the manifest.

- **Global quotas**---restrict the number of service instances across all plans.

    ```
     global_quotas: # optional
        service_instance_limit: INSTANCE-LIMIT
    ```
- **Plan quotas**---restrict the number of service instances for a given plan.

    ```
    plans:
     - name: CF-MARKETPLACE-PLAN-NAME
        plan_id: CF-MARKETPLACE-PLAN-ID
        description: CF-MARKETPLACE-DESCRIPTION
        quotas: # optional
          service_instance_limit: INSTANCE-LIMIT
    ```

When creating a service instance, ODB checks the global service instance limit.
If this limit has not been reached, ODB checks the plan service instance limit.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These limits do not include orphans. See <a href="./troubleshooting-bosh.html#listing-orphans">List Orphan Deployments</a>
   and <a href="./management.html#orphan-deployments">Delete Orphaned Deployments</a>.</p>

## <a id="service-resource-quotas"></a>Service Resource Quotas

ODB offers resource quotas to allow you to limit resources more effectively when combining 
plans that consume different amounts of resources. You can set these quotas for service resources: 

- **Global resource quotas**---limit how much of a certain resource is consumed across all plans.
ODB allows new instances to be created until their total resources reach the global quota.
- **Plan resource quotas**---limit how much of a certain resource is consumed by a specific plan.

When creating a service instance, ODB checks the global resource limit.
If this limit has not been reached, ODB checks the plan resource limit.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: These limits do not include orphans. See <a href="./troubleshooting-bosh.html#listing-orphans">List Orphan Deployments</a>
   and <a href="./management.html#orphan-deployments">Delete Orphaned Deployments</a>.</p>

To set resource quotas, do the following:

1. In the manifest, define the resources you want to limit. 
Use strings to define the resource, for example `ips`, `memory`, or `disk`.
Then decide the total amount allowed for each resource. <br><br>
For example: <br><br>
    - **Global resource quota**

        ```
        service_deployment:
          ...
          global_quotas:
            resource_limits:
              ips: 50
              memory: 150
              ...
        ```
    - **Resource quota for each plan**

        ```
        plans:
        - name: my-plan
          quotas:
            resource_limits:
              memory: 25
        ```

1. In order to use resource quotas, for each plan, you must define the `resource_costs` 
used by one service instance. <br><br>
For example:

    ```
    plans:
    - name: my-plan
      quotas:
        resource_limits:
            memory: 25
      resource_costs:
        memory: 5 # the key is string-matched against keys in the global and plan-level resource quotas
    ```

## <a id="broker-metrics"></a>Broker Metrics

The ODB BOSH release contains a metrics job, which can be used to emit metrics 
when colocated with [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Service Metrics SDK](https://network.pivotal.io/products/service-metrics-sdk/). 
To do this, you must include the [Loggregator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator) release.

Add the following jobs to the broker instance group:

```yaml
- name: service-metrics
  release: service-metrics
  properties:
    service_metrics:
      execution_interval_seconds: INTERVAL-BETWEEN-SUCCESSIVE-METRICS-COLLECTIONS
      origin: ORIGIN-TAG-FOR-METRICS
      monit_dependencies: [broker] # hardcode this
      ....snip....
      #Add Loggregator configuration here: see examples @ https://github.com/pivotal-cf/service-metrics-release/blob/master/manifests
      ....snip....
- name: service-metrics-adapter
  release: ODB-RELEASE
```

You can see an example of how the service metrics can be configured for an on-demand-broker 
deployment in the [kafka-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml#L106) 
manifest.

Pivotal has tested this example configuration with Loggregator v58 and service-metrics v1.5.0.

For more information about service metrics, see [Service Metrics for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/service-metrics).

## <a id="startup-checks"></a>Broker Startup Checks

The ODB does the following startup checks:

* Verifies that the CF and BOSH versions satisfy the minimum versions required. 
If your service offering includes lifecycle errands, the minimum required version for BOSH is higher. 
For more information, see [Set Up Your BOSH Director](#configure-bosh). 
<br><br>
    If your system does not meet minimum requirements, you see an insufficient version error. For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    CF API error: Cloud Foundry API version is insufficient, ODB requires CF v238+.
    </pre>

* Verifies that, for the service offering, no plan IDs have changed for plans that have existing service instances. 
If there are instances, you see the following error:
<pre class="terminal">
You cannot change the plan_id of a plan that has existing service instances.
</pre>

## <a id="broker-stop"></a>Broker Shutdown

The broker tries to wait for any incomplete https requests to complete before shutting down. 
This reduces the risk of leaving orphan deployments in the event that 
the BOSH Director does not respond to the initial `bosh deploy` request. 

You can determine how long the broker waits before being forced to shut down 
using the `broker.shutdown_timeout` property in the manifest. 
The default is 60 seconds. 
For more information, see <a href="#broker-manifest">Write a Broker Manifest</a>.

## <a id="lifecycle-errands"></a>Service Instance Lifecycle Errands

 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature requires BOSH Director v261 or later.</p>

Service Instance lifecycle errands allow additional short-lived jobs to run as part of service instance deployment. 
A deployment is only considered successful if all lifecycle errands successfully exit.

The service adapter must offer the errands as part of the service instance deployment. 
For more information, see [Create a Service Release](./creating.html#create-a-service-release).

ODB supports the following lifecycle errands:

- `post_deploy`---Runs after creating or updating a service instance. An example use case is 
  running a health check to ensure the service instance is functioning. 
  For more information, see [Create/Update Service Instance with Post-Deploy Errands](./concepts.html#post-deploy).
- `pre_delete`---Runs before the deletion of a service instance. 
  An example use case is cleaning up data before a service shutdown. 
  For more information, see [Delete Service Instance with Pre-Delete Errand](./concepts.html#pre-delete).

### <a id="enable-errands"></a> Enable Service Instance Lifecycle Errands

Service Instance lifecycle errands are configured on a per-plan basis. 
Lifecycle errands do not run if you change a plan's lifecycle errand configuration while an existing deployment is in progress.

To enable lifecycle errands, do the following.

1. Add each errand job in the manifest as follows:<br><br>
    - In the `service_deployment`.  See (1) in the example below.
    - In the plan's `lifecycle_errands` configuration.  See (2) in the example below.
    - In the plan's `instance_groups`.  See (3) in the example below.

    Below is an example manifest snippet that configures lifecycle errands for a plan:

    ```yaml
    service_deployment:
      releases:
        - name: SERVICE-RELEASE
          version: SERVICE-RELEASE-VERSION
          jobs:
          - SERVICE-RELEASE-JOB
          - POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB                   # (1)
          - PRE-DELETE-ERRAND-JOB
          - ANOTHER-POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB
    service_catalog:
      plans:
          - name: CF-MARKETPLACE-PLAN-NAME
            lifecycle_errands:
              post_deploy:
              - name: POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB          # (2)
              - name: ANOTHER-POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB
              pre_delete:
              - name: PRE-DELETE-ERRAND-JOB
            instance_groups:
              - name: SERVICE-RELEASE-JOB
                ...
              - name: POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB          # (3)
                lifecycle: errand
                vm_type: VM-TYPE
                instances: INSTANCE-COUNT
                networks: [NETWORK]
                azs: [AZ]
              - name: ANOTHER-POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB
                lifecycle: errand
                vm_type: VM-TYPE
                instances: INSTANCE-COUNT
                networks: [NETWORK]
                azs: [AZ]
              - name: PRE-DELETE-ERRAND-JOB
                lifecycle: errand
                vm_type: VM-TYPE
                instances: INSTANCE-COUNT
                networks: [NETWORK]
                azs: [AZ]
    ```



### <a id="colocated-errands"></a> Colocated Errands

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature requires BOSH Director v263 or later.</p>

You can run both `post-deploy` and `pre-delete` errands as colocated errands.
Colocated errands run on an existing service instance group, instead of a separate one. 
This avoids additional resource allocation.

Like other lifecycle errands, colocated errands are deployed on a per-plan basis. 
Currently the ODB supports colocating only the `post-deploy` or `pre-delete` errands.

For more information, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/errands.html).

To enable colocated errands for a plan, do the following.

1. Add each colocated errand job to the manifest as follows:<br><br>
    - Add the errand in `service_deployment`. See (1) in the example below.
    - Add the errand in the plan's `lifecycle_errands` configuration. See (2) in the example below.
    - Set the instances the errand should run on in the `lifecycle_errands`. See (3) in the example below.

    Below is an example manifest that includes a colocated post-deploy errand:

    ```yaml
    service_deployment:
      releases:
        - name: SERVICE-RELEASE
          version: SERVICE-RELEASE-VERSION
          jobs:
          - SERVICE-RELEASE-JOB
          - COLOCATED-POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB               # (1)
    service_catalog:
      plans:
          - name: CF-MARKETPLACE-PLAN-NAME
            lifecycle_errands:
              post_deploy:
                - name: COLOCATED-POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND-JOB   # (2)
                  instances: [SERVICE-RELEASE-JOB/0]       # (3)
                - name: NON-COLOCATED-POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND
            instance_groups:
              - name: NON-COLOCATED-POST-DEPLOY-ERRAND
                ...
              - name: SERVICE-RELEASE-JOB
                ...
    ```
