## <a id="operator"></a>Operator Responsibilities
The operator is responsible for performing the following:

* Configure the BOSH director
* Upload the required releases for the broker deployment and service instance deployments.
* Write a broker manifest
  * See [v2-style manifest docs](http://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html) if unfamiliar with writing BOSH v2 manifests
  * Core broker configuration
  * Service catalog and plan composition
* Manage brokers

For a list of deliverables provided by the Service Author, see [Required Deliverables](creating.html#what-is-required-of-the-service-authors).

For an example manifest for a Redis service, see [redis-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/redis-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml).

For an example manifest for a Kafka service, see [kafka-example-service-adapter-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml).


## <a id="configure-bosh"></a>Set Up Your BOSH Director

Dependencies for the On-Demand Broker:

- BOSH director v257 or later
- Cloud Foundry v238 or later

### <a id="ssl-certs"></a>SSL Certificates

If ODB is configured to communicate with BOSH on the director's public IP you may be using a self-signed certificate unless you have a domain for your BOSH director. ODB does not ignore TLS certificate validation errors by default (as expected). You have two options to configure certificate-based authentication between the BOSH director and the ODB:

1. Add the BOSH director's root certificate to ODB's trusted pool in the ODB manifest:

    ```yaml
    bosh:
      root_ca_cert: <root-ca-cert>
    ```

1. Use BOSH's `trusted_certs` feature to add a self-signed CA certificate to each VM BOSH deploys. For more details on how to generate and use self-signed certificates for BOSH director and UAA, see [Director SSL Certificate Configuration](https://bosh.io/docs/director-certs.html).

You can also configure a separate root CA certificate that is used when ODB communicates with the Cloud Foundry API (Cloud Controller). This is done in a similar way to above. Please see [manifest snippets below](#core-broker-configuration) for details.

### <a id="bosh-teams"></a>BOSH Teams

BOSH has a teams feature that allows you to further control how BOSH operations are available to different clients. We recommend using it to ensure that your on-demand service broker client can only see deployments it is allowed to. For example, if you [use uaac](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html) to create the client like this:

```bash
uaac client add <client-id> \
  --secret <client-secret> \
  --authorized_grant_types "refresh_token password client_credentials" \
  --authorities "bosh.teams.<team-name>.admin"
```

Then when you [configure the broker's BOSH authentication](#core-broker-configuration), you can use this client ID and secret. The broker will then only be able to perform BOSH operations on deployments it has created itself.

For more details on how to set up and use BOSH teams, see [Director teams and permissions configuration](https://bosh.io/docs/director-users-uaa-perms.html).

For more details on securing how ODB uses BOSH, see [Security](#security).

### <a id="cloud-controller"></a>Cloud Controller

ODB used the Cloud Controller as a source of truth about service offerings, plans, and instances. To reach Cloud Controller, ODB needs to be configured with credentials. These can be either client or user credentials:

* Client credentials: as of Cloud Foundry v238, the UAA client must have authority `cloud_controller.admin`.
* User credentials: a Cloud Foundry admin user, i.e. a member of the `scim.read` and `cloud_controller.admin` groups as a minimum.

Detailed broker configuration is covered [below](#core-broker-configuration).

## <a id="upload-releases"></a>Upload Required Releases

Upload the following releases to the BOSH director:

* on-demand-service-broker
* your service adapter
* your service release(s)

## <a id="broker-manifest"></a>Write a Broker Manifest

### <a id="core-broker-config"></a>Core Broker Configuration

Your manifest should contain one non-errand instance group, that co-locates both:

* the `broker` job from on-demand-service-broker
* your service adapter job from your service adapter release

The broker is stateless and does not need a persistent disk. The VM type can be quite small: a single CPU and 1 GB of memory should be sufficient in most cases.

An example snippet is shown below:

```yaml
instance_groups:
  - name: broker # this can be anything
    instances: 1
    jobs:
      - name: broker
        release: on-demand-service-broker
        properties:
          # choose a port and basic auth credentials for the broker
          port: <broker port>
          username: <broker username>
          password: <broker password>
          disable_ssl_cert_verification: <true|false> # optional, defaults to false. This should NOT be used in production
          cf:
            url: <CF API URL>
            root_ca_cert: <ca cert for cloud controller> # optional, see SSL certificates
            authentication: # either client_credentials or user_credentials, not both as shown
              url: <CF UAA URL>
              client_credentials:
                client_id: <UAA client id with cloud_controller.admin authority and client_credentials in the authorized_grant_type>
                secret: <UAA client secret>
              user_credentials:
                username: <CF admin username in the cloud_controller.admin and scim.read groups>
                password: <CF admin password>
          bosh:
            url: <director url>
            root_ca_cert: <ca cert for bosh director and associated UAA> # optional, see SSL certificates
            authentication: # either basic or uaa, not both as shown
              basic:
                username: <bosh username>
                password: <bosh password>
              uaa:
                url: <BOSH UAA URL> # often on the same host as the director, on a different port
                client_id: <bosh client id>
                client_secret: <bosh client secret>
          service_adapter:
            path: <path to service adapter binary> # optional, provided by the Service Author. Defaults to /var/vcap/packages/odb-service-adapter/bin/service-adapter
          # There are more properties here, that will be discussed below

      - name: <service adapter job name>
        release: <service adapter release>

    vm_type: <vm type>
    stemcell: <stemcell>
    networks:
      - name: <network>
```

This snippet is using the BOSH v2 syntax, and making use of global cloud config and job-level properties.

Please note that the `disable_ssl_cert_verification` option is dangerous and **should not be used in production**.

### <a id="catalog"></a>Service Catalog and Plan Composition

The operator must:

1. Supply each release job specified by the Service Author exactly once. You can include releases that provide many jobs, as long as each required job is provided by exactly one release.
1. Supply one stemcell that is used on each VM in the service deployments. ODB does not currently support service instance deployments that use a different stemcell for different instance groups.
1. Create Cloud Foundry [service metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#services-metadata-fields) in the catalog for the service offering. This metadata will be aggregated in the Cloud Foundry marketplace and displayed in Apps Manager and the `cf` CLI.
1. Compose plans. In ODB, service authors do not define plans but instead expose plan properties. The operator's role is to compose combinations of these properties, along with IAAS resources and catalog metadata into as many plans as they like.
  1. Create Cloud Foundry [service plan metadata](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/catalog-metadata.html#plan-metadata-fields) in the service catalog for each plan.
  1. Provide resource mapping for each instance group specified by the Service Author for each plan.
     The resource values must correspond to valid resource definitions in the BOSH director's global cloud config.
     In some cases Service Authors will recommend resource configuration: e.g. in single-node Redis deployments, an instance count greater than 1 does not make sense.
     Here the operator can configure the deployment to span multiple availability zones, by using the [BOSH multi-az feature](https://bosh.io/docs/azs.html). For example the [kafka multi az plan](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml#L100). In some cases, service authors will provide errands for the service release. You can add an instance group of type errand by setting the lifecycle field. For example the [smoke_tests for the kafka deployment](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kafka-example-service-adapter-release/blob/master/docs/example-manifest.yml#L93).
  1. Provide values for plan properties.
     Plan properties are key-value pairs defined by the Service Author. Some examples include a boolean to enable disk persistence for Redis, and a list of strings representing RabbitMQ plugins to load. The Service Author should document whether these properties are mandatory or optional, whether the use of one property precludes the use of another, and whether certain properties affect recommended instance group to resource mappings.

     Properties can also be specified at the service offering level, where they will be applied to every plan. If there is a conflict between global and plan-level properties, the plan properties will take precedence.
  1. Provide an (optional) update block for each plan.
     You may require plan-specific configuration for BOSH's update instance operation. The ODB passes the plan-specific update block to the service adapter. Plan-specific update blocks should have the same structure as [the update block in a BOSH manifest](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2.html#update). The Service Author can define a default update block to be used when a plan-specific update block is not provided, and whether the service adapter supports their configuration in the manifest.

Add the snippet below to your broker job properties section:

```yaml
service_deployment:
  releases:
    - name: <service-release>
      version: <service-release-version>
      jobs: [<release-jobs-needed-for-deployment>] # Service Author will specify list of jobs required
  stemcell: # every instance group in the service deployment has the same stemcell
    os: <service-stemcell>
    version: <service-stemcell-version>

            unit: <frequency of cost>
      quotas: # optional
        service_instance_limit: <instance limit>
      instance_groups: # resource mapping for the instance groups defined by the Service Author
        - name: <service author provided instance group name>
          vm_type: <vm type>
          instances: <instance count>
          networks: [<network>]

        update_watch_time: 1000-30000 # required
        serial: true # optional
```

## <a id="route"></a>Route Registration

You can optionally colocate the `route_registrar` job from the [routing release](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-routing-release?all=1) with the on-demand-service-broker, in order to:

1. load balance multiple instances of ODB using Cloud Foundry's router
1. access ODB from the public internet

To do this, upload the release to your BOSH director and [configure the job properties](http://bosh.io/jobs/route_registrar?source=github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-routing-release&version=0.136.0), replacing the version in that docs URL query string as appropriate.

Remember to set the `broker_uri` property in the [register-broker errand](#register-broker) if you configure a route.

## <a id="broker-metrics"></a>Broker Metrics

The ODB bosh release contains a metrics job, that can be used to emit metrics when colocated with [service metrics](https://network.pivotal.io/products/service-metrics-sdk/). You must include the loggregator release in your manifest order to do this.

Use [loggregator v58+](https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator?v=58) and [service-metrics v1.4.3+](https://network.pivotal.io/products/service-metrics-sdk/).

Add the following jobs to the broker instance group:

```yaml
- name: service-metrics
  release: service-metrics
  properties:
    service_metrics:
      execution_interval_seconds: <interval between successive metrics collections>
      origin: <origin tag for metrics>
      metrics_command: /var/vcap/jobs/odb-metrics/bin/gather-metrics.sh # hardcode this
      metrics_command_args: [] # hardcode this
      monit_dependencies: [broker] # hardcode this
- name: metron_agent
  release: loggregator
  properties:
    metron_agent:
      deployment: <deployment tag for metrics>
    metron_endpoint:
      shared_secret: <metron secret>
    loggregator:
      etcd:
        machines: [<CF etcd IPs>]
    loggregator_endpoint:
      shared_secret: <loggregator secret>
- name: odb-metrics
  release: <ODB release>
```

Please see the [service metrics docs](http://docs.pivotal.io/service-metrics) for more details on service metrics.

## <a id="management"></a>Broker Management

Management tasks on the broker are performed with BOSH errands.

### <a id="register"></a>register-broker

This errand registers the broker with Cloud Foundry and enables access to plans in the service catalog. The errand should be run whenever the broker is re-deployed with new catalog metadata to update the Cloud Foundry catalog.

Please note that if the `broker_uri` property is set, then you should also register a route for your broker with Cloud Foundry. See [Route registration](#route-registration) section for more details.

When `enable_service_access: false` is set the errand will disable service access for all plans. Individual plans can be disabled by setting `active: false` in the `plan` section of the broker job properties. See [catalog](#catalog) for details.

Add the following instance group to your manifest:

```yaml
- name: register-broker
  lifecycle: errand
  instances: 1
  jobs:
    - name: register-broker
      release: <odb-release-name>
      properties:
        broker_name: <broker-name>
        broker_uri: <broker URI, only required when a route has been registered> # optional
        disable_ssl_cert_verification: <true|false> # defaults to false
        enable_service_access: <true|false> # defaults to true
        cf:
          api_url: <cf-api-url>
          admin_username: <cf-api-admin-username>
          admin_password: <cf-api-admin-password>
  vm_type: <vm-type>
  stemcell: <stemcell>
  networks: [{name: <network>}]
  azs: [<az>]
```

Run the errand with `bosh run errand register-broker`.

### <a id="deregister-broker"></a>deregister-broker

This errand deregisters a broker from Cloud Foundry. It requires that there are no existing service instances.

Add the following instance group to your manifest:

```yaml
- name: deregister-broker
  lifecycle: errand
  instances: 1
  jobs:
    - name: deregister-broker
      release: <odb-release-name>
      properties:
        broker_name: <broker-name>
        disable_ssl_cert_verification: <true|false> # defaults to false
        cf:
          api_url: <cf-api-url>
          admin_username: <cf-api-admin-username>
          admin_password: <cf-api-admin-password>
  vm_type: <vm-type>
  stemcell: <stemcell>
  networks: [{name: <service-network>}]
  azs: [<az>]
```

Run the errand with `bosh run errand deregister-broker`.

### <a id="admin-instances"></a>Administer Service Instances

We recommend using the [bosh cli gem](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-cli.html) for administering the deployments created by ODB; for example for checking VMs, ssh, viewing logs.

We **recommend against** using the bosh cli for updating/deleting ODB service deployments as it might accidentally trigger a race condition with Cloud Controller-induced updates/deletes or result in ODB overriding your [snowflake](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html) changes at the next deploy. All updates to the service instances must be done using the [errand to upgrade existing service instances](#upgrading-existing-service-instances).

### <a id="upgrade-broker"></a>Upgrade the Broker

The broker is upgraded in a similar manner to all BOSH releases:

* upload relevant releases (typically ODB and a Service Adapter)
* make any necessary manifest changes
* deploy the manifest

Often, a broker upgrade will involve an upgrading of the service release(s). In this case, upload the new version of the service release(s) and change the broker manifest properties to deploy these newer versions. Any new instances will use the new versions, but you must use an [errand to upgrade existing service instances](#upgrading-existing-service-instances).

### <a id="upgrade-instances"></a>Upgrade Existing Service Instances

1. Ensure you have the `upgrade-sub-deployments` errand instance group on the broker manifest

    ```yaml
    - name: upgrade-sub-deployments
      lifecycle: errand
      instances: 1
      jobs:
        - name: upgrade-sub-deployments
          release: <odb-release-name>
      vm_type: <vm>
      stemcell: <stemcell>
      networks: [{name: <network>}]
      azs: [<az>]
    ```
1. Update the broker properties under `service_deployment/releases` to the required service release versions and `service_deployment/stemcell` has the required stemcell version
1. Upload the releases and stem cells specified in the `service_deployment` section of properties to the BOSH director
1. Ensure latest broker manifest is deployed.
1. Run the errand with `bosh run errand upgrade-sub-deployments`.

Note that if a developer runs `cf update-service` on an outdated instance, they will have their instance upgraded regardless of whether or not the operator ran the errand.

### <a id="delete-instances"></a>Delete Service Instances

This errand deletes all service instances of your broker's service offering in every org and space of Cloud Foundry. It uses the Cloud Controller API to do this, and therefore only deletes instances the Cloud Controller knows about. It will not help you terminate "rogue" BOSH deployments, those that don't correspond to a known instance (this *should* never happen, but in practice it might).

**This should only be done with extreme caution, when you want to totally destroy an environment.**

Add the following instance group to your manifest:

```yaml
- name: delete-sub-deployments
  lifecycle: errand
  instances: 1
  jobs:
    - name: <delete-sub-deployments>
      release: *broker-release
      properties:
        timeout_minutes: <time to wait for all instances to be deleted> # defaults to 60
        disable_ssl_cert_verification: <true|false> # defaults to false
        cf:
          api_url: <cf-api-url>
          admin_username: <cf-api-admin-username>
          admin_password: <cf-api-admin-password>

  vm_type: small
  stemcell: trusty
  networks: [{name: redis}]
  azs: [<az>]
```

Run the errand with `bosh run errand delete-sub-deployments`.

### <a id="updating-service-plans"></a>Update Service Plans


Service plans can be updated by changing the plan properties in the `service_catalog` for the broker. All service plan properties except the `service_id` and `plan_id` are modifiable. After the changing the catalog, you should update the cf marketplace using the `cf update-service-broker` command. The updated plan properties would be applied to newly created instances. To apply the plan properties to already provisioned instances, the [update sub-deployments errand](#upgrading-existing-service-instances) has to be run.


### <a id="disabling-service-plans"></a>Disable Service Plans

Access to a service plan can be disabled by using the cloudfoundry api.

On the cli you can use
```
cf disable-service-access <service-name-from-catalog> -p <plan-name>
```

### <a id="remove-plans"></a>Remove Service Plans

A service plans can be removed if there are no instances using the plan. To remove the a plan, remove it from the broker manifest and update the cf marketplace by using the `cf update-service-broker` command. If a plan with deployed service instances from the broker manifest, the broker will fail to startup.

## <a id="security"></a>Security

### <a id="bosh-endpoints"></a>BOSH API Endpoints

The ODB accesses the following [BOSH API](https://bosh.io/docs/director-api-v1.html) endpoints during the service instance lifecycle:

| API endpoint                                                     | Examples of usage in the ODB                                                                                                                                 |

- `bosh deploy`
- `bosh delete deployment`
- `bosh run errand`

Read only:

- `bosh deployments`
- `bosh vms`
- `bosh tasks`

The minimum UAA authority required by the BOSH Director to perform these actions is `bosh.teams.<team>.admin`. Note: a team admin cannot view or update the director's cloud config, nor upload releases or stemcells.

For more details on how to set up and use BOSH teams, see [Director teams and permissions configuration](https://bosh.io/docs/director-users-uaa-perms.html).

#### Unused BOSH permissions
The team admin authority also allows the following actions, which currently are not used by the ODB:

- `bosh start/stop/recreate`
- `bosh cck`
- `bosh ssh`
- `bosh logs`
- `bosh releases`
- `bosh stemcells`

### <a id="ipsec"></a>PCF IPsec Add-On

The ODB has been tested with the [PCF IPsec Add-On](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html), and it appears to work. Note that we excluded the BOSH director itself from IPsec ranges, as the BOSH add-on cannot be applied to BOSH itself.

### <a id="logs"></a>Logs

The on-demand broker writes logs to a log file, and to syslog.

The broker log contains error messages and non-zero exit codes returned by the service adapter, as well as the stdout and stderr streams of the adapter.

The log file is located at `/var/vcap/sys/log/broker/broker.log`. In syslog, logging is written with the tag `on-demand-service-broker`, under the facility `user`, with priority `info`.

If you want to forward syslog to a syslog aggregator, we recommend co-locating [syslog release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/syslog-release) with the broker.

The ODB generates a UUID for each request and prefixes all the logs for that request, e.g.

```
on-demand-service-broker: [on-demand-service-broker] [4d63080d-e038-45a3-85f9-93910f6b40b1] 2016/09/05 16:43:26.123456 a valid UAA token was found in cache, will not obtain a new one
```

NB: The ODB's negroni server and start up logs are not prefixed with a request ID.

All ODB's logs have a UTC timestamp.

### <a id="metrics"></a>Metrics

If you have [configured service metrics](#broker-metrics), then metrics should be visible from loggregator. You can consume these by using the [CF CLI firehose plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/firehose-plugin).

For each plan, the metrics will report how many instances there are of that plan and if a quota is set how much of that quota is remaining. The metrics are in the format shown below.

```
origin:"<broker deployment name>" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:<timestamp> deployment:"<broker deployment name>" job:"broker" index:"<bosh job index>" ip:"<IP>" valueMetric:<name:"/on-demand-broker/<service offering name>/<plan name>/total_instances" value:<instance count> unit:"count" >
origin:"<broker deployment name>" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:<timestamp> deployment:"<broker deployment name>" job:"broker" index:"<bosh job index>" ip:"<IP>" valueMetric:<name:"/on-demand-broker/<service offering name>/<plan name>/quota_remaining" value:<quota remaining> unit:"count" >
```

If `quota_remaining` is `0` then you need to increase your plan quota in the BOSH manifest.

### <a id="identifying-deployments"></a>Identify Deployments in BOSH

There is a one to one mapping between the service instance id from CF and the deployment name in BOSH. The convention is the BOSH deployment name would be the service instance id prepended by `service-instance_`. To identify the BOSH deployment for a service instance you can.

1. Determine the GUID of the service

    ```
    cf service --guid <service-name>
    ```

2. Identify deployment in `bosh deployments` by looking for `service-instance_`GUID

3. Get current tasks for the deployment by using

    ```
    bosh tasks --deployment service-instance_<GUID>
    ```

### <a id="id-tasks"></a>Identify Tasks in BOSH

Most operations on the on demand service broker API are implemented by launching BOSH tasks. If an operation fails, it may be useful to investigate the corresponding BOSH task. To do this:

1. Determine the ID of the service for which an operation failed. You can do this using the Cloud Foundry CLI:

    ```
    cf service --guid <service name>
    ```

1. SSH on to the service broker VM:

    ```
    bosh deployment <path to broker manifest>
    bosh ssh
    ```

1. In the broker log, look for lines relating to the service, identified by the service ID. Lines recording the starting and finishing of BOSH tasks will also have the BOSH task ID:

    ```

    ```

1. Use the task ID to obtain the task log from BOSH (adding flags such as `--debug` or `--cpi` as necessary):

    ```
    bosh task <task_ID>
    ```

### <a id="id-uaa-issues"></a>Identify Issues When Connecting to BOSH or UAA

The ODB interacts with the BOSH director to provision and deprovision instances, and is authenticated via the director's UAA. See [Core Broker Configuration](#core-broker-configuration) for an example configuration.

If BOSH and/or UAA are wrongly configured in the broker's manifest, then meaningful error messages will be displayed in the broker's log, indicating whether the issue is caused by an unreachable destination or bad credentials.

For example

```
on-demand-service-broker: [on-demand-service-broker] [575afbc1-b541-481d-9cde-b3d3e67e87bf] 2016/05/18 15:56:40.100579 Error authenticating (401): {"error":"unauthorized","error_description":"Bad credentials"}, please ensure that properties.<broker-job>.bosh.authentication.uaa is correct and try again.
```

### <a id="listing-instances"></a>List Service Instances

The ODB persists the list of ODB-deployed service instances and provides an endpoint to retrieve them. This endpoint requires basic authentication.

During disaster recovery this endpoint could be used to assess the situation.

**Request**

`GET http://username:password@<REPLACE_WITH_BROKER_IP>:8080/mgmt/service_instances`

**Response**

200 OK

Example JSON body:

  ```json
